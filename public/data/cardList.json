Of course, as \"Alien\" and its aptly titled sequel \"Aliens\" grew into something much bigger, the career-minded actress started to get cold feet. Wary of portraying Ripley ad infinutum, and fearing the franchise would circle the drain, Weaver decided to end her attachment to the role after David Fincher's troublesome trilogy-wrapper \"Alien 3.\"</p> <p>Speaking to throngs of xeno-heads at the London Film and Comic Con in 2015, she explained to <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sigourney-weaver-alien-predator-depressed-809786\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> her desire to disassociate with the character: with rumors of a forthcoming \"Alien vs. Predator\" movie, she decided Fox's cash-grab could cheapen the impact of the series, which she said \"depressed me because I was very proud of the movies.\" The crossover may not have set the world ablaze, but it could have been much, much worse. As it happened, she didn't stay away from her legendary role for long, returning for the so-so 1998 sequel \"Alien: Resurrection.\"</p>",

After entering the number three elevator shaft and looking forward, they spotted what appeared to be a vintage automobile with distinctive features: a square back, curved fenders, and remnants of a shredded soft top. Most notably, flashes of chrome on the bumper and fender caught their attention – details considered unusual for standard military equipment.</p> <p>Based on these observations, NOAA researchers believe the vehicle might be a 1940-41 Ford Super Deluxe “Woody,” a wood-bodied civilian vehicle that seems strangely out of place aboard a warship. This unexpected find has sparked considerable interest and speculation among historians and automotive enthusiasts.</p> <p>How did a civilian vehicle end up inside a military aircraft carrier that sank during one of World War II’s most significant naval battles? NOAA researchers have proposed several intriguing theories:</p> <p>One hypothesis suggests the car might have been the personal or flag vehicle of Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher, who commanded the USS Yorktown during the Battle of Midway. Such vehicles were sometimes transported aboard larger naval vessels for use when commanders went ashore.</p> <p>Alternatively, the car may have been brought aboard for quick repairs after sustaining damage during the Battle of the Coral Sea, which had occurred just a month before Midway. Ships with mechanical facilities sometimes assisted with unexpected repair needs during wartime operations.</p>",

During the livestreamed exploration, one ROV operator made a <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/culture/noaa-spots-mystery-car-inside-wwii-carrier-uss-yorktown-shipwreck\" rel=\"noopener\">direct appeal</a>: “Here’s an open request to all your automobile vehicle folks out there. I’m sure you are being attentive to this and you understand what you are looking at. Please post on this. It helps.”</p> <p>If verified, this discovery could provide a deeply personal connection to one of America’s most famous naval losses, linking the strategic decisions of a fleet commander to a sunken car that has remained hidden from daylight for over eight decades.</p> <p>The current expedition, named “<a href=\"https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/okeanos-beyond-the-blue/ex2503/welcome.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Beyond the Blue</a>: Papahānaumokuākea ROV and Mapping,” continues throughout April and May 2025. NOAA teams are conducting further dives in the monument’s deep waters, with each exploration offering new insights into both the natural ecosystems and historical artifacts preserved beneath the Pacific Ocean.</p> <p>The USS Yorktown wreck site represents just one of many fascinating locations being studied during this comprehensive scientific mission. As exploration technologies continue to advance, researchers anticipate making additional discoveries that may further enhance our understanding of naval history and the legacy of World War II in the Pacific.</p> <p>Discoveries like the mystery car inside the USS Yorktown highlight the importance of continued marine exploration and historical preservation efforts. <a href=\"https://www.gadgetreview.com/15-most-mysterious-shipwrecks-that-hid-priceless-historical-treasures\">Many Mysterious Shipwrecks</a> have hidden valuable treasures, and exploring these wrecks not only uncovers rare artifacts but also brings us closer to understanding significant historical events.</p> <p>As NOAA’s expedition continues, the story of the USS Yorktown and its unexpected automotive passenger serves as a reminder that history often reveals itself in surprising and meaningful ways. Through careful documentation and collaborative research, we can ensure these underwater time capsules continue to share their stories with future generations.</p>",

This insight has upended how regulators and companies must tackle methane: focusing only on big leaks is like bailing water with a teaspoon while the boat has dozens of small holes.<br><br>Satellite monitoring is now the only way to track these countless, often unreported, leaks across huge geographic areas.",

                "caption": "Until recently, methane leaks from oil and gas fields were largely invisible—hidden both from the public and often from regulators. That changed dramatically in 2024 with the deployment of MethaneSAT, a satellite mission spearheaded by the Environmental Defense Fund.<br><br>MethaneSAT has been scanning 12 major oil and gas regions worldwide, detecting an astonishing 1,300 tonnes of methane released per hour between July 2024 and January 2025. This volume of methane is not just an environmental catastrophe; it’s economically shocking, representing roughly $200,000 worth of lost gas every single hour.<br><br>By turning a once-invisible problem into something you can see from space, MethaneSAT has forced the industry to confront leaks they never publicly admitted. According to MethaneSAT’s project director, “We’re seeing things that just weren’t possible to monitor before.” The satellite’s data is now at the heart of urgent policy debates, shaking up both industry and government.<br><br>What was hidden is now undeniable—and the numbers are too big to ignore.",

She pointed out that even small, persistent leaks can add up to a major climate threat over time.<br><br>The emotional urgency in her voice was clear: ignoring these invisible emissions could undermine decades of progress.

In Turkmenistan’s Amu Darya Basin, one of the world’s largest gas-producing regions, satellite images caught a dramatic drop in methane emissions from 203 tonnes per hour in July to much lower levels just a few months later in October.<br><br>But this wasn’t a simple fix—emissions didn’t disappear; they shifted, highlighting how methane releases can be episodic and unpredictable. These wild swings challenge old assumptions that leaks are constant or easily managed.<br><br>“Methane is like a ghost—it comes and goes, and you need eyes everywhere to catch it,” said an emissions monitoring expert in late 2024. Such findings have sparked calls for real-time monitoring, not just annual inspections, as the only way to catch the industry’s slippery emissions in the act.",

Yet, satellite data from 2024–2025 paints a very different picture, especially in the Permian Basin, America’s largest oil field.<br><br>There, the actual loss rate is measured at 1.8% to 2.9%—a whopping 9 to 14 times higher than the industry’s public commitment. This gap exposes a credibility crisis for the sector, as well as for regulators relying on self-reported data.<br><br>“The numbers don’t lie,” says a leading climate watchdog. “The loss rates we’re seeing on satellite images make it clear the current approach isn’t working.” These stark differences have fueled public distrust and calls for tougher, independent oversight backed by real-time satellite evidence.",
