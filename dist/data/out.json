        "Body": "<img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1FDw2l\">  <p>Described as a \"living ninja weapon,\" <b>Kaze</b> is a geisha with superior skills that set her as arguably one of the most powerful <a href=\"https://mobilematters.gg/brawl-stars/brawl-stars-every-brawler-listed\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brawlers</a> in the <i>Brawl Stars.</i></p>  <p>She is the first <b>Ultra Legendary Brawler</b> in the game. Now, all Brawlers who fall within this rarity will have something special about their abilities and skills. In Kaze's case, her special ability is the fact that she's two Brawlers in one. What does this mean? She can swap between her two Aspects \u2013 <b>Ninja</b> and <b>Geisha</b> \u2013 at any time in a match. Needless to say, she's quite powerful.</p>  <p>Kaze is an <a href=\"https://mobilematters.gg/brawl-stars/all-brawler-classes-in-brawl-stars\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Assassin Brawler</a>, so you can expect her to be able to deal large bursts of damage and ambush enemies. She's perfect for 1v1 battles and close-quarter combat that exist in <a href=\"https://mobilematters.gg/brawl-stars/brawl-stars-game-modes-guide\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">game modes</a> such as Duels, Showdown, or Knockout.</p>  <h2>Kaze's Main Attack & Super in Geisha Aspect</h2>  <p>In Kaze's Geisha Aspect, her weapons are bladed fans. Her <b>Main Attack</b> sees her dash forward over a short distance to attack enemies from close range. It's important to know that these attacks have a unique Strike Spot. If you hit an enemy within this Spot, you will deal extra damage and reset the Strike Spot to a new position.</p>  <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1FDs95\">  <p>Kaze's Super in her <b>Geisha Aspect</b> is known as Fan Storm, a wide area-of-effect (AoE) ability that reduces visibility for enemies inside and damages them if they touch it.</p>  <h2>Kaze's Main Attack & Super in Ninja Aspect</h2>  <p>In her Ninja Aspect, Kaze throws two knives, one after the other, in a single direction, for her <b>Main Attack</b>. This medium-range attack will deal more damage to enemies who are nearer to her.</p>  <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1FDpha\">  <p>For her Ninja Aspect Super, Kaze will dash forward over a long distance. All enemies she passes through will be marked and take damage after a short time.</p>  <h2>Gadgets, Star Powers & Hypercharge</h2>  <p>The <b>Gagets, Star Powers,</b> and <b>Hypercharge</b> you get can be used in both her Geisha and Ninja Aspects. However, it's important to note that each one will provide a different ability depending on the Aspect Kaze is in. We'll explain them below.</p>  <p>Kaze's <b>Gadgets</b> are as follows;</p>  <table>      <tr>    <td><b>Name</b></td>    <td><b>Description</b></td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Gracious Host</td>    <td>    <ul>     <li><b>Geisha:</b> Switch to Ninja Aspect and gain Movement Speed for 2.5 seconds</li>     <li><b>Ninja:</b> Switch to Geisha Aspect and heal for 30% of maximum HP</li>    </ul></td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Hensojutsu</td>    <td>    <ul>     <li><b>Geisha:</b> Switch to Ninja Aspect and gain invisibility for 2 seconds.</li>     <li><b>Ninja: </b>Switch to Geisha Aspect and dash forward.</li>    </ul></td>   </tr>     </table>  <p>Kaze's <b>Star Powers</b> are as follows:</p>  <table>      <tr>    <td><b>Star Power</b></td>    <td><b>Description</b></td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td><p>Advanced Techniques</p></td>    <td>    <ul>     <li><b>Geisha:</b> Hitting an enemy in a Strike Spot also slows them by 30% for 2.5 seconds.</li>     <li><b>Ninja:</b> Increases duration of Gadget effects by 50%</li>    </ul></td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Gratuity Included</td>    <td>    <ul>     <li><b>Geisha:</b> Removes 34% of ammo from Brawlers initially caught in the Fan Storm.</li>     <li><b>Ninja: </b>When a marked enemy is defeated, they will deal area damage to other enemies.</li>    </ul></td>   </tr>     </table>  <p>Kaze's <b>Hypercharge</b> is as follows:</p>  <table>      <tr>    <td><b>Hyperchage</b></td>    <td><b>Description</b></td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>Ancient Energy</td>    <td>    <ul>     <li><b>Geisha:</b> The center of the Fan Storm damages enemies over time.</li>     <li><b>Ninja:</b> Kaze gains increased dash speed and her marks instantly damage if the target's health is low enough to be defeated.</li>    </ul></td>   </tr>     </table>  <p>The pricing for these items is the same as usual. Gadgets cost 1,000 Coins, Star Powers cost 2,000 Coins, and the Hypercharge costs 5,000 Coins.</p>  <h2>Best Build for Kaze</h2>  <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1FDnoI\">  <p>The best build should be designed to play to Kaze's strengths: <b>her incredible Assassin skills at close range.</b></p>  <ul>   <li><b>Gadget</b>: Hensojutsu</li>   <li><b>Star Power:</b> Advanced Techniques</li>   <li><b>Gears:</b> Damage and Shield</li>  </ul>  <p>The <b>Hensojutsu Gadget</b> enables her to switch to the Ninja Aspect and gain invisibility for 2 seconds. Use this to your advantage to close the gap between enemies, where you can then pounce with her ranged attack. This Gadget allows her to swap to her Geisha Aspect and dash forward at the same time, enabling Kaze to get enemies within her Strike Spot.</p>         <p>We chose the <b>Advanced Techniques Star Power</b> because it increases the duration of Gadget effects by 50% when Kaze is in her Ninja Aspect. Pair this with the Hensojutsu Gadget, and you'll gain another second of invisibility, which can be crucial for sneaking up on enemies. This Star Power will also slow enemies struck in Kaze's Strike Spot by 30% for 2.5 seconds.</p>  <p>Finally, we suggest picking the <b>Damage</b> and <b>Shield</b> <a href=\"https://mobilematters.gg/brawl-stars/all-gears-in-brawl-stars-explained\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gears</a>. Kaze doesn't have a high amount of HP, so picking the Shield Gear will give her a bit of protection you can use to soak up damage. The Damage Gear allows Kaze to deal more damage when her HP falls below 50%.</p>",

He especially loved how much control these stovetops offer.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.thecooldown.com/induction-stoves/\" title=\"Induction Stoves\" rel=\"noopener\">Induction stoves</a> work by creating heat in cookware itself. This is done by rapidly shifting electromagnetic fields, which excite iron atoms in the cookware.\u00a0</p>    <p>By simply dialing up the electromagnetic wriggling, chefs can produce specific results beyond \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\".\u00a0</p>    <p>Besides a better cooking experience overall, there are loads of additional benefits by <a href=\"https://links.thecooldown.com/induction\">switching to induction</a>. Switching off gas means cutting out <a href=\"https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/gas-stove-emissions-indoor-air-quality/\">harmful gas by-products in the home</a>. These can have steep health costs, especially for kids with asthma.\u00a0</p>    <p>Since there are no active heating elements on an induction stove, they're also <a href=\"https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/invisible-cooktop-induction-stove-kids-safety-kitchen/\">safer to use</a>. The glass top holds onto residual heat generated by the pan, and even then, only for a short period.\u00a0\u00a0</p>    <p>Best of all, electrifying cooking means reducing <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/commercial-and-residential-sector-emissions\">home energy emissions</a>. <a href=\"https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/methane-overheating-the-planet/\" title=\"What is methane?

By switching to an induction stove, you can help slow down that damage.\u00a0</p>    <div class=\"wp-block-tcd-multipurpose-gutenberg-block container-small\"><h4><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rRAWY-3BBg\">Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?</a></h4></div>    <p>Cost is a factor, but help is available. Some portable induction surfaces can be available for <a href=\"https://links.thecooldown.com/induction\">as little as $50</a>, and are perfect for renters.\u00a0</p>    <p>Gas manages its energy-to-heat transfer at an efficiency of roughly 40%, but <a href=\"https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf\">induction stoves do it at 90%</a>, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. This efficiency can quickly translate into savings on monthly utility bills, making it worth the purchase cost in the long haul.\u00a0</p>    <p>Federal incentives can help homeowners enjoy the benefits of induction cooking while taking the sting out of the up-front investment cost.

Nevertheless, if you're <a href=\"https://www.motherandbaby.com/getting-pregnant/trying-to-conceive/\">trying to conceive</a>, you might be wondering how early <a href=\"https://www.motherandbaby.com/pregnancy-and-birth/pregnancy/morning-sickness-causes-symptoms-treatment\">morning sickness</a> can start, to give you that first hint that you might be pregnant.

If you can't keep food down and are suffering from severe vomiting, contact your doctor to discuss potential treatment.</p> <p>If you're looking out for the start of morning sickness, you should keep an eye on the following symptoms:</p> <p>\u2022 A nauseous feeling similar to car sickness or seasickness.</p> <p>\u2022 Aversions to certain smells that seem very powerful, they can make you feel physically sick.</p> <p>\u2022 Feelings of sickness can often be followed by hunger.</p> <p>\u2022 Nausea after eating.</p> <p>Contrary to what the name suggests, morning sickness can occur at any time of the day but pregnant women often find it's worse first thing in the morning before they've eaten. Finding a <a href=\"https://www.motherandbaby.com/pregnancy/health-and-wellness/best-breakfasts-to-ease-morning-sickness/\">breakfast to help ease morning sickness</a> can help.</p> <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1FWia0\"><h2 id=\"h-when-does-morning-sickness-start-with-twins\">Does morning sickness start earlier with twins?</h2> <p>While you're more likely to have it if you're <a href=\"https://www.motherandbaby.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/pregnant-with-twins/\">pregnant with twins</a>, morning sickness doesn't normally start earlier with twins. However, the increased hormone levels with twins does make it more likely that you'll have morning sickness and can mean it's more severe, so it can be an early sign that you carrying more than one baby.</p> <h2 id=\"h-when-does-morning-sickness-end\">When does morning sickness end?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vomiting-and-morning-sickness/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">According to the NHS</a>, most women find their morning sickness calms down once they begin their <a href=\"https://www.motherandbaby.com/pregnancy/month-by-month/second-trimester/\">second trimester</a>, and for 9 out of 10 women morning sickness usually clears up by <a href=\"https://www.motherandbaby.com/pregnancy-and-birth/pregnancy/pregnancy-week-by-week/week-20-twenty-weeks-pregnant\">week 20</a> of their pregnancy. However, if you're continuing to experience sickness after this time, speak to your midwife or GP. {#Morning sickness symptoms}</p> <h2 id=\"h-what-does-early-morning-sickness-mean\">What does early morning sickness mean?</h2> <p>If you find you suffer from morning sickness before four weeks, this is normal. While morning sickness is unlikely to start at 1 week, some women suffer from nausea very early on during pregnancy although it is not usually accompanied by vomiting. At as early as <a href=\"https://www.motherandbaby.com/pregnancy-and-birth/pregnancy/pregnancy-week-by-week/two-weeks-pregnant\" rel=\"noopener\">two weeks pregnant</a>, certain strong smells (like perfume or food) may trigger nausea. If you've had multiple pregnancies and previously experienced morning sickness, you may notice nausea as a symptom earlier than other women.</p> <h2 id=\"h-what-does-it-mean-if-i-don-t-have-morning-sickness\">What does it mean if I don't have morning sickness?</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/pregnancy-sickness-cause\">University of Cambridge</a> notes that 7 in 10 women will suffer from morning sickness but if you don't, there's no need to worry. Some women may suffer from nausea without vomiting and some women don't experience any nausea or vomiting at all. As the study noted, it's all down to a hormone produced by the foetus \u2013 a protein known as GDF15. How sick, if at all, the mother feels is largely due to how much of the hormone is produced by the foetus and how much exposure the mother had to the hormone before becoming pregnant.</p> <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1FWmpz\"><h2 id=\"h-morning-sickness-remedies-recommended-by-real-mums\">Morning sickness remedies recommended by real-mums</h2> <p>If you're here for <a href=\"https://www.motherandbaby.com/pregnancy-and-birth/pregnancy/help-with-morning-sickness/morning-sickness-remedies\">morning sickness remedies</a>, you're in the right place.

Even water made me vomit.\"</p> <p><strong>Patrice McDonald:</strong>\u00a0\"Dry cream crackers helped...plus crystallised ginger (easier to cope with than raw ginger). I later asked the GP for anti-sickness tablets, but in the end they prescribed antacids which really helped (much better than just drinking Gaviscon by the bottle)!\"</p> <p><strong>Rachel Train:</strong>\u00a0\"It\u2019s trial and error. I had sickness with all my 3 pregnancies and I found eating plain food regularly helped me. Marmite sandwiches on white bread was my saviour from starvation, and plain baked potatoes, cream crackers and rich tea biscuits. Sucking on mints helped with nausea. And I found a tummy setting tea morning sickness tea that did actually help!\"</p> <p><strong>Holly Ashton:</strong>\u00a0\"I was sick for months and nothing really helped. Even anti sickness tablets from the Drs! I tried all the tricks but the only thing that seemed to keep it at bay at all was eating a little and often.

        "Body": "<p>From Italy to Greece and Portugal, off-label use of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro for weight loss is creating a booming private market\u2014and a brewing public health dilemma.</p> <p>In a matter of just a few years, Europe has witnessed an unprecedented shift in how one class of medications\u2014so-called GLP-1 receptor agonists\u2014is perceived and used. </p> <p>Originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, these injectable drugs are now fueling a multibillion-euro weight loss industry, driven by private demand, social media hype, and regulatory gaps. </p> <p>The new \u201cweight loss hysteria\u201d started in the United States, where the prices for the drugs remain highest, but people are still willing to pay $1,300 (\u20ac1,142) each month without insurance coverage. </p> <p>The tendency is now exploding in Europe and is not limited to those with medical conditions and obesity, but spreading to those seeking a novel approach to getting a beach-ready body. But what price are we willing to pay for the dream body across Europe?</p> <h2><strong>Italy: A tenfold leap in spending</strong></h2> <p>Italy\u2019s private market for GLP-1 drugs exploded in 2024, reaching a staggering \u20ac26 billion in global anti-obesity drug spending, a more than tenfold increase compared to 2020. </p> <p>According to Pharma Data Factory (PDF), private spending on GLP-1 agonists doubled from \u20ac52 million in 2023 to over \u20ac115 million in 2024.</p> <p>This surge stems from a rising trend: off-label use of anti-diabetic drugs for weight loss. Since such use is not currently covered by Italy\u2019s national health service, most of the spending has come directly from patients\u2019 pockets.</p> <p>There is, however, movement at the policy level. The recent Act No 741, which officially recognises obesity as a chronic disease, may pave the way for future reimbursement under Italy\u2019s provisions for insurance Essential Levels of Care (LEA). </p> <p>For the time being, however, prescriptions are typically limited to specialists and often require proof of a high body mass index or conditions related to diabetes.</p> <h2><strong>Greece: Soaring demand, strict rules</strong></h2> <p>The phenomenon is mirrored in Greece, where usage of anti-obesity drugs surged by 82.5% in 2024, with \u20ac93 million in total spending. Ozempic\u2019s popularity has skyrocketed, and the market has since expanded to include Mounjaro, introduced in November 2024.</p> <p>Despite consumer enthusiasm, Greek regulations remain among the strictest in Europe. </p> <p>Prescribing these drugs for obesity is technically forbidden, except in life-threatening cases. Physicians must prove a diagnosis of diabetes to prescribe them, making legitimate weight-loss prescriptions almost impossible through official channels.</p> <p>But regulatory rigidity has not slowed the underground momentum. With Mounjaro sales now hitting 12,000 units per month, price cuts\u2014such as the 23% drop announced by Pharmaserve-Lilly in February\u2014are expected to further accelerate the drug\u2019s spread, whether legal or otherwise.</p> <p><div class=\"widget widget--type-image widget--size-fullwidth widget--animation-fade-in widget--align-center\">   <div class=\"widget__wrapper\">     <div class=\"widget__ratio widget__ratio--auto\">       <div class=\"widget__contents\">         <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G3iRR\">       </div>     </div>   </div> </div> </p> <h2><strong>Portugal: A market without reimbursement</strong></h2> <p>In Portugal, the weight loss drug phenomenon is newer but no less intense. In the first four months of 2025 alone, Portuguese consumers spent nearly \u20ac20 million on GLP-1-based injectables like tirzepatide (Mounjaro) and semaglutide (Wegovy)\u2014both of which are officially approved for obesity treatment.</p> <p>In just two months of 2024, over 10,000 units of tirzepatide were sold, while Wegovy, introduced in April 2025, has racked up sales of 6,800 units in a single month. With each Wegovy injection costing EUR 244.80, the trend shows no signs of slowing.</p> <p>Ozempic, while not officially approved for weight loss, continues to be widely used off-label.

        "Body": "<p>From Italy to Greece and Portugal, off-label use of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro for weight loss is creating a booming private market\u2014and a brewing public health dilemma.</p> <p>In a matter of just a few years, Europe has witnessed an unprecedented shift in how one class of medications\u2014so-called GLP-1 receptor agonists\u2014is perceived and used. </p> <p>Originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, these injectable drugs are now fueling a multibillion-euro weight loss industry, driven by private demand, social media hype, and regulatory gaps. </p> <p>The new \u201cweight loss hysteria\u201d started in the United States, where the prices for the drugs remain highest, but people are still willing to pay $1,300 (\u20ac1,142) each month without insurance coverage. </p> <p>The tendency is now exploding in Europe and is not limited to those with medical conditions and obesity, but spreading to those seeking a novel approach to getting a beach-ready body. But what price are we willing to pay for the dream body across Europe?</p> <h2><strong>Italy: A tenfold leap in spending</strong></h2> <p>Italy\u2019s private market for GLP-1 drugs exploded in 2024, reaching a staggering \u20ac26 billion in global anti-obesity drug spending, a more than tenfold increase compared to 2020. </p> <p>According to Pharma Data Factory (PDF), private spending on GLP-1 agonists doubled from \u20ac52 million in 2023 to over \u20ac115 million in 2024.</p> <p>This surge stems from a rising trend: off-label use of anti-diabetic drugs for weight loss. Since such use is not currently covered by Italy\u2019s national health service, most of the spending has come directly from patients\u2019 pockets.</p> <p>There is, however, movement at the policy level. The recent Act No 741, which officially recognises obesity as a chronic disease, may pave the way for future reimbursement under Italy\u2019s provisions for insurance Essential Levels of Care (LEA). </p> <p>For the time being, however, prescriptions are typically limited to specialists and often require proof of a high body mass index or conditions related to diabetes.</p> <h2><strong>Greece: Soaring demand, strict rules</strong></h2> <p>The phenomenon is mirrored in Greece, where usage of anti-obesity drugs surged by 82.5% in 2024, with \u20ac93 million in total spending. Ozempic\u2019s popularity has skyrocketed, and the market has since expanded to include Mounjaro, introduced in November 2024.</p> <p>Despite consumer enthusiasm, Greek regulations remain among the strictest in Europe. </p> <p>Prescribing these drugs for obesity is technically forbidden, except in life-threatening cases.

As part of our quest to get to the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.rd.com/article/food-facts-trivia/\">surprising food facts</a>, we dug into why people store milk differently across the pond. Read on to learn the real reason milk is not kept in the fridge in Europe\u2014and whether it\u2019s a safe way to sip this staple.</p><img data-reference=\"slideshow\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/slideshow/AA1G8lBA\" /> <p class=\"p1\"><b>Get\u00a0</b><b><i>Reader\u2019s Digest</i></b><b>\u2019s\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://www.rd.com/newsletter/?int_source=direct&int_medium=rd.com&int_campaign=nlrda_20221001_topperformingcontentnlsignup&int_placement=incontent\"><span><b>Read Up newsletter</b></span></a><b> for more food news, humor, cleaning, travel, tech and fun facts all week long.</b></p> <h2 class=\"p1\">Why is milk in Europe not stored in the fridge?</h2> <p><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G8hMc\"></p> <p>Believe it or not, until milk is opened, it doesn\u2019t need to be refrigerated. And get this\u2014most of the world doesn\u2019t store unopened milk in the fridge!</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean you can get away with this type of milk storage As it turns out, the major difference lies in the method by which milk is processed. Almost all milk is pasteurized, meaning it undergoes extreme heat to kill illness-causing bacteria. The United States and Canada use a pasteurizing\u00a0 the technique called high-temperature short-time pasteurization, or HTST. On the plus side, HTST is cheaper and more efficient because it processes milk in larger batches. But as a result, <a href=\"https://www.rd.com/article/how-long-milk-lasts/\">American milk has a shorter shelf life</a>\u2014around seven to 10 days\u2014and must be refrigerated.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the world uses ultra-high-temperature or ultra-heat-treated pasteurization (UHT), which heats the milk to an even higher temperature than HTST. The result: Shelf-stable milk that stays fresh outside of the fridge for about three months. So that answers the question \u201cWhy is milk not refrigerated in Europe?\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be refrigerated to be safe to drink!</p> <h2 class=\"p1\">Why doesn\u2019t the U.S. use UHT milk?</h2> <p>In the early 1990s, one company attempted to sell UHT milk on American shelves, but it never caught on. Why? For starters, the high temperatures make UHT milk taste a bit more \u201ccooked\u201d than HTST milk. But Americans\u2019 obsession with refrigeration is largely to blame\u2014we like things cold and also really worry that milk that\u2019s not cold isn\u2019t actually safe. (It is a lot to get your head around!)</p> <p>So forget about whether you consider your glass half full or half empty.

However, the truth about carbohydrates is far more nuanced than what you'll see on social media or hear from the latest fad diet gurus. Cutting carbs drastically may offer temporary results, but for many people, this approach isn\u2019t sustainable. Plus, cutting carbs may result in nutritional gaps or other undesirable outcomes. Can a low-carb diet be beneficial for certain people? Absolutely. But it\u2019s not for everyone. Instead of seeing carbs as the enemy, it\u2019s time to take a more balanced approach that fosters a positive relationship with food and keeps your body functioning at its best.</p><h2>What Are Carbs, and Why Do They Matter?</h2><p>Carbs are one of the primary <a href=\"https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291112/what-macros-are-right-for-weight-loss/\">macronutrients</a>, alongside fats and proteins. They serve as a major energy source for the body, particularly for the brain and muscles. Carbs are often broken down into glucose, which fuels everything from your daily activities to intense workouts. <a href=\"https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/\">Complex carbs</a>, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, also come packed with essential vitamins, fiber and other nutrients that your body needs to thrive. Restricting carbs, or completely cutting out certain nutrient-dense carbs, means you could miss out on key nutrients and energy your body needs to function properly.\u00a0</p><h2>Why Cutting Carbs Can Backfire</h2><p>Restricting carbs might seem appealing at first, especially given that low-carb diets like keto or Atkins are often touted for their rapid results. But here\u2019s the catch! What works in the short term may fail when it comes to long-term wellness. Here\u2019s why.</p><h3>You May Experience Nutritional Gaps</h3><p>\u201cMany carb-rich foods like starchy vegetables, whole grains, fruits and legumes are also extremely nutrient dense,\u201d shared <a href=\"https://www.feedyourzest.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">McKenzie Caldwell</a><a href=\"https://www.feedyourzest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">, M.P.H., RDN.</a> \u201cCutting carbs can result in inadequate intake of important nutrients and food compounds including folate, antioxidants and fiber,\u201d McKenzie added. A 2025 study shows that low-carb diets are linked to deficiencies of micronutrients like vitamin C, iron and magnesium, which may result in negative implications in the long run.</p><p>Another study published in 2022 looked at the eating habits of 307 U.S. adults who followed a low-carbohydrate diet and compared what these individuals are to the daily nutritional goals outlined in the 2020\u20132025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The study found that people on low-carb diets were consuming too much saturated fat, total fats, and sodium. At the same time, they weren\u2019t getting enough fiber, magnesium, potassium and several important vitamins like A, E, D and, in some cases, C and folate.</p><h3>You May Feel Low Energy</h3><p>\u201cOne reason why cutting carbs can backfire is because it often leads to low energy,\u201d shared <a href=\"https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samantha DeVito</a><a href=\"https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">, M.S., RD</a>. \u201cCarbohydrates are your body\u2019s preferred fuel source, especially for your brain and muscles, so when you drastically reduce your intake, you might feel sluggish, irritable or find it harder to concentrate,\u201d DeVito explained.</p><p>Simple carbohydrates, often found in <a href=\"https://www.eatingwell.com/added-sugar-drinks-study-8760752\">high-added-sugar foods</a>, can lead to energy crashes and have been linked to poorer brain health and reduced cognitive performance over time. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates, like those found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, provide a steady, long-lasting source of energy and have been associated with improved memory and better brain health as we age.</p><h3>It\u2019s Unsustainable for Most People</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons cutting carbs backfires is the sheer difficulty of maintaining such a restrictive diet. Eventually, most people revert to their previous eating patterns, often feeling like they\u2019ve \u201cfailed.\u201d This cycle of deprivation and overindulgence can harm not just your physical health but also your mental well-being.</p><p>\u201cCutting carbs completely can seem effective at first, but it often leads to burnout; not because people lack discipline, but because it\u2019s logistically and socially unrealistic,\u201d explained <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/\">Johannah Katz, M.A., RD</a>. \u201cCarbs are part of most meals, cultures and shared experiences. When they\u2019re demonized or off-limits, it can create an \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 mindset, which makes people feel like they\u2019ve failed if they have even a small amount,\u201d she explained.\u00a0</p><p>Cultural, religious and economic barriers pose unique challenges to achieving nutritional compliance with low carbohydrate diets.</p><p>\u201cRigidity fuels guilt, yo-yo dieting, and ultimately, a strained relationship with food. Sustainable progress comes from flexibility and learning how to include the right kinds of carbs (understanding complex vs simple carbohydrates), not avoid them altogether,\u201d Katz explained.</p><h3>It May Negatively Impact Your Gut Health</h3><p>\u201cBy cutting carbs, you could be compromising on your gut health,\u201d explained <a href=\"https://amandasauceda.com\">Amanda Sauceda</a><a href=\"https://amandasauceda.com/\">, M.S., RD</a>. \u201cFiber, which is critical for a healthy gut, is a type of carbohydrate.\u00a0 90% of people are already not meeting their fiber recommendations so by cutting carbs you could also be making it harder to reach your fiber goals,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cIf you were to cut carbs then you might notice an increase in constipation and it could result in gut microbiome changes,\u201d Sauceda added.</p><p>When choosing your carbs, it\u2019s important to choose the right ones. Eating high-quality carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits and vegetables is linked to a 33.7% lower risk of constipation. On the flip side, consuming less nutritious carbs like high-added-sugar snacks and refined grains increased constipation risk by 83.4% in an analysis.</p><h2>What to Do Instead of Cutting Carbs</h2><p>If cutting carbs isn\u2019t the answer, what\u2019s the alternative? The good news is that you don\u2019t have to totally avoid carbohydrates to feel your best. Instead, focus on incorporating a balanced, sustainable approach to eating that works for you personally.</p><ul><li><strong>Choose Quality Over Quantity</strong>: Not all carbs are created equal. Refined carbs, like white bread and high-added-sugar drinks, are stripped of certain nutrients and may cause blood sugar spikes. On the other hand, complex carbs, like whole grains, sweet potatoes and brown rice, are a natural source of fiber, vitamins and minerals. Focus on adding these nutrient-dense options to your meals rather than avoiding carbs altogether.</li><li><strong>Keep Your Meals Balanced</strong>: Instead of fixating on cutting out a particular food group, aim to create balanced meals that include protein, healthy fats and carbohydrates. For instance, pair whole-grain pasta with lean protein like chicken or plant-based options, plus some olive oil and a handful of veggies. This approach ensures you\u2019re fueling your body with what it truly needs without feeling deprived.</li><li><strong>Prioritize Consistency Over Perfection:</strong> Rather than aiming to eat \u201cperfectly,\u201d focus on consistent habits that support your overall well-being. That might mean having oatmeal for breakfast most days while occasionally enjoying a donut when the mood strikes. Balance is key. There\u2019s no need to label foods as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d.</li><li><strong>Stay Active and Hydrated</strong>: Physical activity and hydration are essential compliments to your nutrition. Exercise helps regulate blood sugar and supports gut health, while drinking enough water can help keep gut health in-check too.</li></ul><h2>Our Expert Take</h2><p>Carbohydrates are not the villain they\u2019ve been made out to be. Your body needs them to function properly and to feel its best. Cutting carbs may offer short-term results, but it often leads to long-term frustration, fatigue and health challenges. By focusing on balance, variety, and listening to your body, you can create a way of eating that nourishes and sustains you over the long haul.</p><p>Remember, eating is not about perfection; it\u2019s about supporting your life in a way that feels good and works for you.

When they detect danger, they rapidly multiply and transform into effector cells that destroy pathogens. This transformation demands an intense burst of DNA replication\u2014so fast that it puts the entire genome under pressure.</p> <p>But how do these cells avoid falling apart under that stress? Researchers have found that <a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-transforms-ordinary-fat-cells-into-cancer-killing-machines/\">T cells</a> rely on a crucial molecule called Apex1 to protect their DNA during this high-speed replication. Without it, the immune response falters, and the cells can\u2019t do their job.</p> <h2>How Apex1 Shapes T Cell Immunity</h2> <p>Once T cells are activated, their energy needs skyrocket. Their metabolism kicks into overdrive, pumping out reactive oxygen species (ROS). These molecules create a toxic environment that makes DNA especially vulnerable to damage during replication.</p> <p><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6D4f\"></p><p>Each activated T cell can generate up to 400,000 apurinic/apyrimidinic (A/P) sites in a single day. These are spots where the <a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-dna-based-supercomputer-runs-100-billion-tasks-at-once/\">DNA base</a> is missing\u2014a type of lesion that threatens the stability of the genome. If left unrepaired, such damage can push cells toward malfunction or death.</p> <p>That\u2019s where Apex1 comes in. This enzyme is among the first to detect these damaged sites. It cuts the DNA at the damaged point and calls in other repair tools, working quickly to restore the sequence before the damage spreads.</p> <p>Thanks to Apex1, <a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/human-genome-mapping-uncovers-50000-mysterious-dna-structures/\">the genome holds together</a> long enough for T cells to complete their transformation. Without it, the DNA damage piles up. The cells lose their ability to fight, and many end up dying through apoptosis before they can help.</p> <p><strong>Related Stories</strong></p> <p>\u30fb<a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/nasal-spray-alternative-to-the-epipen-is-a-life-changer-for-people-with-allergies/\">Nasal spray alternative to the EpiPen is a life changer for people with allergies</a></p><p> \u30fb<a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/early-exposure-to-peanuts-significantly-reduces-the-likelihood-of-peanut-allergies-later-in-life/\">Early exposure to peanuts significantly reduces the likelihood of peanut allergies later in life</a></p><p> \u30fb<a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/world-first-clinical-trial-to-help-millions-with-penicillin-allergies/\">World-first clinical trial to help millions with penicillin allergies</a></p> <h2>Groundbreaking Advances in Understanding and Treating Autoimmune Disorders</h2> <p>Researchers at the <a href=\"https://www.houstonmethodist.org\">Houston Methodist Research Institute</a> recently explored this process in greater detail. Their study, published in the <a href=\"https://www.jci.org/articles/view/183671\">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, highlights the essential role of Apex1 in regulating the immune response.</p> <p>Led by Dr. Xian C. Li and Dr. Zhiqiang Zhang, the team removed Apex1 from T cells in mice. These Apex1-deficient cells couldn\u2019t launch an autoimmune response. The results point to a new treatment strategy: targeting Apex1 might help suppress harmful immune activity in autoimmune diseases.</p> <p>One striking discovery was the complete prevention of lupus-like symptoms in murine models when the Apex1 gene was deleted. Typically, lupus causes immune cells to attack the body\u2019s tissues, leading to protein leakage in urine, kidney damage, and the production of harmful autoantibodies. However, models lacking Apex1 exhibited none of these symptoms and lived significantly longer than their counterparts.</p> <p><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6QNE\"></p><p>Dr. Li remarked on the potential impact of this research: \u201cWe were surprised by the potency of suppressing multiple <a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/nightmares-could-be-an-early-warning-sign-of-lupus-and-other-autoimmune-diseases/\">autoimmune diseases</a>\u2014not only in prevention but also in treatment once the diseases were already established\u2014upon blocking that single Apex1 molecule.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers also demonstrated that chemical inhibitors targeting Apex1 induced extensive death of harmful T cells, offering further proof of its therapeutic potential.</p> <h2>Apex1 as a Therapeutic Target</h2> <p>Unlike broad-spectrum treatments, targeting Apex1 affects only T cells that are actively proliferating in response to a perceived threat. This specificity minimizes unwanted side effects, making it a precise and promising approach for autoimmune therapy.</p> <p><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6Mln\"></p><p>Current treatments for diseases like lupus and multiple sclerosis often suppress the <a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/revolutionary-molecule-combats-autoimmune-diseases-including-lupus-and-crohn-s-disease/\">immune system</a> indiscriminately, leaving patients vulnerable to infections. By contrast, Apex1 inhibitors focus on the subset of T cells responsible for the disease, preserving the overall immune response.</p> <p>The research team\u2019s findings mark a significant departure from earlier approaches. By targeting Apex1, they demonstrated a way to selectively eliminate destructive T cells without affecting dormant or healthy ones.</p> <p>Dr. Li emphasized, \u201cFor those suffering from diseases like <a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-have-finally-discovered-the-cause-of-lupus/\">lupus</a>, multiple sclerosis, or allergies, approaches to inhibit Apex1 may be the best way to cure the diseases, as those harmful T cells are eliminated through cell death.\u201d</p> <p>The implications of this research extend beyond autoimmune diseases. The team plans to explore the role of Apex1 in transplant medicine, where T cell-mediated graft rejection remains a major challenge. By inhibiting Apex1, they aim to develop therapies that promote long-term transplant survival.</p> <p><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6Mlo\"></p><p>\u201cOur goal in the next stage of studies is to test Apex1 inhibitors and Apex1 gene knockout in organ transplant models,\u201d said Dr. Li. \u201cWe will try to develop new protocols and better therapies for transplant patients.\u201d</p> <p>To advance this promising line of research, the team is focusing on the rational design of chemical compounds that selectively target Apex1. This step is crucial for translating laboratory findings into clinical applications. Additional preclinical studies and clinical trials will be needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these inhibitors in humans.</p> <h2>Broader Implications for Genomic Stability</h2> <p>The importance of Apex1 extends to its role in maintaining genomic stability across various cell types. In <a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-cancer-research-converts-cancer-cells-back-into-normal-cells/\">cancer research</a>, Apex1 is recognized for its ability to repair DNA damage and prevent mutations.</p> <p>This dual role highlights the molecule\u2019s significance in both protecting against malignancies and facilitating precise immune responses. The balance between these functions underscores the complexity of targeting Apex1 therapeutically.</p> <p><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6QNI\"></p><p>In T cells, the ability to repair DNA damage rapidly and efficiently is crucial for their transformation into cytotoxic effectors. Without this capability, the <a href=\"https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-reveals-the-impact-of-space-travel-on-the-human-immune-system/\">immune system</a>\u2019s response to infections and diseases would be severely compromised. The discovery of Apex1\u2019s role in this process provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies that harness the body\u2019s natural repair mechanisms.</p> <p>The researchers\u2019 work offers a roadmap for future studies aimed at uncovering additional molecular players in T cell biology.

        "Body": "<img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1FNoDG\" /><p>For countless individuals, the word \"exercise\" often conjures images of relentless effort, sore muscles, and a persistent internal monologue debating the merits of just one more repetition. It's often viewed as a necessary punishment for the sake of health, a chore to be endured rather than embraced. But what if we told you there's a simple, yet profound, mental trick that can fundamentally transform your relationship with physical activity, turning it from a dreaded obligation into a genuine source of pleasure?</p>  <p>\"Our perception of exercise is hugely influenced by our mindset,\" explains Dr. Anya Sharma, a sports psychologist specializing in motivation. \"If we frame it as a sacrifice or a battle, our brain will naturally resist. But by shifting our internal narrative, we can tap into the inherent rewards of movement, making it something we actually look forward to.\"</p>  <p>The secret lies not in a new workout routine or a fancy piece of equipment, but in a powerful cognitive reframing technique that focuses on the intrinsic joys of movement rather than solely on external outcomes like weight loss or muscle gain. This isn't about ignoring health benefits, but about finding immediate, sensory gratification in the act itself.</p>  <p>The Mental Hack: Focus on the \"Pleasure of Movement,\" Not the \"Pain of Gain\"</p>  <p>The core of this mind trick is simple: shift your focus from the perceived effort or the future result, and instead, intentionally tune into the immediate, positive sensations of your body in motion.</p>  <p><strong>Here\u2019s how to put this into practice:</strong></p>  <p><strong>Tune In, Don't Tune Out:</strong></p>  <p>Traditional Approach: Many people try to distract themselves during exercise \u2013 loud music, TV, thinking about errands. This reinforces the idea that exercise is something to get through.</p><p>The Hack: Instead, consciously pay attention to how your body feels. Notice the rhythm of your breath, the feel of your feet on the ground, the gentle stretch of your muscles, the flow of movement. It's a form of mindfulness applied to physical activity.</p><p><strong>Seek Out Sensations You Enjoy:</strong></p>  <p>The Hack: If you love the feeling of gliding, try swimming or skating. If you enjoy the sensation of stretching, embrace yoga or Pilates. If you like feeling strong, focus on the power in your legs during a run or the activation of your core during a plank. Experiment until you find movements that feel good to you.</p><p>Example: Instead of \"I have to run 3 miles,\" try \"I'm going to enjoy the feeling of the breeze, the rhythm of my steps, and the way my body feels strong and alive.\"</p><p>Frame It as Exploration, Not Obligation:</p>  <p>The Hack: See your body as an instrument capable of incredible things, and exercise as an opportunity to explore its capabilities. Think of it as a personal experiment in movement.</p><p>Example: \"How far can my body comfortably go today?\" or \"What new stretch can I discover?\" rather than \"I must hit this target.\"</p><p><strong>Connect to Natural Rhythms:</strong></p>  <p>The Hack: Take your workout outdoors. Feel the sun on your skin, the wind in your hair, the varying terrain beneath your feet. Connecting with nature can enhance the sense of pleasure and freedom.</p><p>Example: A hike isn't just exercise; it's an immersive sensory experience.</p><p><strong>Embrace the Post-Exercise Glow:</strong></p>  <p>The Hack: Don't just finish and rush off. Take a moment to savor the feeling of accomplishment, the endorphin rush, the relaxed state of your muscles, and the renewed clarity of your mind. This positive reinforcement encourages future engagement.</p><p><strong>The Psychology Behind the Shift:</strong></p>  <p><strong>This mental hack works because it taps into several powerful psychological principles:</strong></p>  <p>Intrinsic Motivation: When we focus on the inherent enjoyment of an activity, we become intrinsically motivated, meaning we do it for its own sake, not just for external rewards or to avoid punishment. This makes the habit far more sustainable.</p><p>Mindfulness: By bringing present-moment awareness to our bodies and sensations, we reduce the mental struggle and enhance the positive feedback loop.</p><p>Positive Association: Consistently associating exercise with positive physical and emotional sensations rewires our brain to anticipate pleasure, rather than pain, from physical activity.</p><p>By consciously shifting our internal dialogue and tuning into the genuine pleasure of movement, we can transform exercise from a dreaded chore into a joyous and sustainable part of our lives. It's a testament to the incredible power of the mind-body connection, offering a path to a happier, healthier, and more active you.</p>",

A recent study by the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance Project revealed a grim outlook, finding that \"more than 39 million lives will be claimed between now and 2050\" due to drug-resistant infections. It also found that such infections were responsible for at least 1 million deaths each year since 1990.</p>    <p>This issue prompted the United Nations General Assembly to hold a high-level meeting that resulted in a collaboration of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the U.N.

This challenge requires a \"One Health approach,\" which <a href=\"https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/how-the-uns-helping-govts-to-tackle-amr/189678/\">Alvarez</a> described as \"linking the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and their wider environment to create a cohesive and sustainable response.\"</p>    <p>Among the chief concerns regarding the release of <a href=\"https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/superbugs-climate-change-rising-temperates/\">antimicrobials and antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms</a> into the environment is the production of waste and wastewater across sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry, health care facilities, and agriculture. <a href=\"https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/how-the-uns-helping-govts-to-tackle-amr/189678/\">Alvarez</a> explained that combating <a href=\"https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/dirty-energy-fossil-fuel-sources/\">pollution</a> is a key step toward reducing exposure to antimicrobials.</p>    <p>\"At the global level, the environmental aspects of AMR include promoting healthcare waste management standards and ensuring universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene in healthcare settings,\" <a href=\"https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/how-the-uns-helping-govts-to-tackle-amr/189678/\">Alvarez stated</a>. \"It involves a broad range of actions: strengthening multi-sectoral engagement in AMR National Action Plans, preventing and reducing the release of antimicrobials and AMR pathogens across key sectors, enhancing surveillance systems, and promoting research and raising awareness.\"</p>    <div class=\"wp-block-tcd-multipurpose-gutenberg-block container-small\"><h4><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Pgtq77NUU\">Watch now: Is this common bathroom item making you sick? </a></h4></div>    <p>In addition to the global response, the U.N.

That\u2019s because mosquitoes are selective insects, and some people are more likely to get bites than others.\u00a0</p><p>There are a few factors that could contribute to why this happens: In\u00a0<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjennabirch%2Fwhy-mosquitoes-bite-blood-type-sc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%3FDb%3Dpubmed%26Cmd%3DShowDetailView%26TermToSearch%3D15311477%26ordinalpos%3D3%26itool%3DEntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&xcust=7884082%7CRSS&xs=1\">one controlled study</a>\u00a0by the Journal of Medical Entomology, the bugs landed on people with blood Type O nearly twice as frequently as those with Type A. The researchers noted this has to do with secretions we produce, which tips mosquitoes off on a person\u2019s blood type.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>More research needs to be conducted on mosquitoes\u2019 potential preference for certain blood types over others, said Jonathan F. Day, an entomology professor at the University of Florida. But he agreed that mosquitoes do pick up on some cues we give off that make the bugs more likely to land on certain people.</p><p>\u201cThese cues let them know they are going to a blood source,\u201d Day said. \u201cPerhaps CO2 is the most important. The amount of CO2 you produce, like people with high metabolic rates \u2015 genetic, other factors \u2015 increases the amount of carbon dioxide you give off. The more you give off, the more attractive you are to these arthropods.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>But what separates us from the nonliving entities that give off carbon dioxide, like cars? Mosquitoes look for primary cues in conjunction with what Day calls \u201csecondary cues.\u201d</p></div><div><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6D3z\"></div><div><p>Lactic acid \u2014 the stuff that causes our muscles to cramp during exercise \u2014 is one of those secondary cues, for example. Lactic acid is released through the skin, signaling to mosquitoes that we are a target, Day said.</p><p>Mosquitoes also have other qualities that help them pick up on secondary cues.</p><p>\u201cMosquitoes have excellent vision, but they fly close to the ground to stay out of the wind,\u201d Day said. \u201cThey are able to contrast you with the horizon, so how you\u2019re dressed matters. If you have on dark clothes, you are going to attract more because you\u2019ll stand out from the horizon, whereas those wearing light colors won\u2019t as much.\u201d</p><p>A mosquito also takes in \u201ctactile cues\u201d once it has landed on you.</p></div><div><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6OZx\"></div><div><p>\u201cBody heat is a really important tactile cue,\u201d Day said. \u201cThat comes into play with genetic differences or physiological differences. Some people tend to run a little warmer \u2014 when they land, they\u2019re looking for a place where blood is close to the skin.\u201d That means those whose temperatures are a little higher are more likely to get the bite.</p><p>Lifestyle or other health factors may also play a role, said Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>\u201cIf body temperature is higher, you\u2019re exercising and moving around a lot, or if you\u2019re drinking alcohol, you are more attractive to mosquitoes,\u201d Piliang said. \u201cBeing pregnant or being overweight also increases metabolic rate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjennabirch%2Fwhy-mosquitoes-bite-blood-type-sc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%3FDb%3Dpubmed%26Cmd%3DShowDetailView%26TermToSearch%3D12083361%26ordinalpos%3D3%26itool%3DEntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&xcust=7884082%7CRSS&xs=1\">One study</a> showed that people who consumed just one can of beer were more at risk of attracting mosquitoes than those who didn\u2019t. Of course, drinking outside is a popular summer and fall activity.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve been moving around all day doing yardwork and then you stop around dusk and drink a beer on your patio, you\u2019re definitely at risk of bites,\u201d Piliang said.\u00a0</p><h2><strong>How To Prevent Mosquito Bites</strong></h2></div><div><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6OZG\"></div><div><p>Just because you might be more prone to bites doesn\u2019t mean they have to be an inevitability.</p><p>\u201cOne of the very best things to do is to avoid peak activity times [for mosquitoes],\u201d Day said. \u201cThere are very, very few species that are active in the middle of the day. They are very selective. Sunrise and sunset are when you\u2019ll see peak activity.\u201d Switching your early morning run to an after-work run could help here.</p><p>Of course, this tip won\u2019t help you if you\u2019re, say, throwing a BBQ for friends later at night. Try to cover as much skin as you can in these cases, Day said, especially in areas or at times mosquitoes are <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/evelinamedina/most-likely-to-questions\">most likely to</a> be present.</p><p>\u201cI love the fishing shirts and the long-legged outdoor pants that are breathable, but they prevent mosquitoes,\u201d Day said. \u201cA repellent that has a good protection time \u2015 defined as the time from when you apply to when you get the first bite \u2015 is also great. Roughly 5% DEET sprays gives you 90 minutes of complete coverage.\u201d</p></div><div><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6D3M\"></div><div><p>DEET is a common ingredient in insect repellents, and sprays with DEET are probably the way to go if you know you\u2019re at risk of bites, Piliang said. Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjennabirch%2Fwhy-mosquitoes-bite-blood-type-sc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Finsect-repellents%2Fdeet&xcust=7884082%7CRSS&xs=1\">a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency</a>\u00a0re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one\u2019s health, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjennabirch%2Fwhy-mosquitoes-bite-blood-type-sc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fwestnile%2Fprevention%2Findex.html&xcust=7884082%7CRSS&xs=1\">including</a> children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.</p><p>\u201cDEET is the most effective,\u201d Piliang said. \u201cIf you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet.

You can get bleeding, scabs and put yourself at risk for infection and scarring.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>But there are a few simple things you can do to alleviate the itch, like putting an ice cube on it. \u201cThe sensation of cold travels on the same nerve as itch, so you cannot feel both at the same time,\u201d Piliang said. \u201cEven a drink with ice on it will help relieve itch immediately.\u201d</p><p>If you\u2019ve received several bites after a morning or evening outside, she also recommended over-the-counter anti-itch creams with a mild topical steroid like hydrocortisone. \u201cYou can apply that two to three times a day to reduce itch,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the last thing you can do if you\u2019re really bit up is take an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjennabirch%2Fwhy-mosquitoes-bite-blood-type-sc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedlineplus.gov%2Fency%2Fpatientinstructions%2F000549.htm&xcust=7884082%7CRSS&xs=1\">antihistamine</a>,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can counteract the reaction a bit.\u201d While OTC types that make you drowsy \u2014 like Benadryl \u2014 are more common, you can take non-drowsy antihistamines like Zyrtec or Allegra for daytime relief.</p><p>Of course, prevention is always better than treatment, so use these tips to stave off bites in the first place as you head out for the season\u2019s remaining BBQs and tailgates.\u00a0<em>This article originally appeared on</em> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjennabirch%2Fwhy-mosquitoes-bite-blood-type-sc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fwhy-mosquitoes-bite-blood-type-ano_l_6669b71de4b076909e1cc8e2&xcust=7884082%7CRSS&xs=1\"><em>HuffPost.</em></a></p></div>",

If you've been battling insomnia, waking up feeling drained, or simply want to optimize your sleep game, this guide is your ultimate blueprint for achieving the deep, rejuvenating sleep you deserve.</p>  <h4>The Silent Epidemic: Why We're So Sleep-Deprived</h4>  <p>Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to understand why so many Americans are struggling to catch enough Zs. Our modern lifestyles are rife with sleep disruptors: the blue light emitted from our screens, the pervasive stress of daily life, irregular work schedules, and a culture that often prioritizes productivity over rest. The consequences are far-reaching, contributing to everything from reduced cognitive function and weakened immune systems to an increased risk of chronic diseases. But the good news is, reclaiming your sleep isn't about drastic overhauls; it's about implementing consistent, intelligent habits.</p>  <h4>Your Top 5 Proven Tips for Deeper Sleep, Starting Tonight:</h4>  <h5>Master Your Sleep Schedule: Consistency is King (and Queen!)</h5>  <p>This might sound obvious, but it's the bedrock of healthy sleep. Go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every single day, even on weekends. This regular rhythm helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle, known as your circadian rhythm. When your body knows what to expect, it can more effectively prepare for sleep, leading to faster fall-asleep times and more consistent, deeper sleep. Even a one-hour deviation on weekends can throw your system off.</p>  <h5>Optimize Your Sleep Sanctuary: Transform Your Bedroom into a Restful Oasis</h5>  <p>Your bedroom should be a haven dedicated to rest. Think of it as your personal sleep pod.</p>  <ul>   <li>Darkness is Your Friend: Even a sliver of light can disrupt melatonin production, the hormone that signals sleep. Invest in blackout curtains or an eye mask.</li>   <li>Cool It Down: Most sleep experts recommend a room temperature between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit (15-19 degrees Celsius). A cooler environment signals to your body that it's time to wind down.</li>   <li>Silence is Golden: Minimize noise with earplugs, a white noise machine, or even a fan.</li>   <li>Comfort is Key: Ensure your mattress and pillows provide adequate support and comfort. They are investments in your health!</li>  </ul>  <h5>Unplug and Unwind: Embrace a Digital Sunset</h5>  <p>This is perhaps one of the most challenging, yet impactful, tips. The blue light emitted from smartphones, tablets, and computers suppresses melatonin production and tricks your brain into thinking it's still daytime. Aim for a \"digital sunset\" at least 60-90 minutes before bed. Instead of scrolling, try reading a physical book, listening to a calming podcast, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretching. This transition period allows your mind and body to slowly decompress from the day's stimulation.</p>  <h5>Mindful Eating and Drinking: Fuel Your Sleep, Don't Fight It</h5>  <p>What you consume throughout the day, and particularly in the hours leading up to bedtime, significantly impacts your sleep quality.</p>  <ul>   <li>Limit Caffeine and Alcohol: While alcohol might initially make you feel drowsy, it disrupts sleep cycles later in the night. Caffeine, a stimulant, should be avoided at least 6-8 hours before bed.</li>   <li>Avoid Heavy Meals Late: A large, rich meal right before bed can lead to indigestion and discomfort, making it harder to fall asleep. Opt for a lighter snack if you're truly hungry.</li>   <li>Stay Hydrated, But Wisely: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, but taper off your intake in the evening to avoid frequent nighttime bathroom trips.</li>  </ul>  <h5>Cultivate a Relaxing Bedtime Routine: Signal to Your Body It's Time to Rest</h5>  <p>Just as you have a morning routine to kickstart your day, an evening routine signals to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include:</p>  <ul>   <li>A warm bath or shower to lower your body temperature slightly after getting out.</li>   <li>Light stretching or yoga.</li>   <li>Reading a calming book (non-digital).</li>   <li>Listening to soothing music or guided meditation.</li>   <li>Practicing deep breathing exercises. The key is consistency and choosing activities that genuinely help you feel calm and relaxed.</li>  </ul>  <h4>Invest in Your Sleep, Invest in Yourself</h4>  <p>Getting enough quality sleep isn't a luxury; it's a fundamental pillar of good health, productivity, and overall happiness. By consistently implementing these five proven tips, you're not just aiming for more hours in bed; you're striving for deeper, more restorative sleep that will profoundly impact every aspect of your waking life. Start small, be patient, and celebrate each step towards better sleep. Your body and mind will thank you for it, and you'll soon discover just how sweet those dreams can be.</p>",

(NASDAQ: TRAW) has unveiled key clinical efficacy data for rigosertib, showcasing its potential as a treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) associated with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). The findings, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, mark a significant step forward in addressing a devastating disease with no approved therapies.</p> <p>The data stems from the first clinical trial of an experimental cancer treatment specifically targeting RDEB-associated SCC. Results demonstrated an impressive overall response rate of 80%, with complete responses in 50% of evaluable patients.</p> <p>\u201cThese data indicate that rigosertib is a potential treatment for cutaneous SCC in RDEB patients, where there is a substantial unmet need and no approved therapies,\u201d said Victor Moyo, MD, Chief Medical Officer Oncology at Traws Pharma. \u201cThe aggressive course of this disease is inadequately addressed by current treatment regimens, which produce limited response rates of mostly short duration.\u201d</p> A Critical Unmet Need <p>RDEB is a monogenic condition characterized by insufficient expression of type VII collagen, which compromises the structural integrity of the skin. This results in chronic blistering, wound formation, and frequent infections. Many patients with RDEB eventually develop metastatic SCC, an aggressive and deadly complication driven by overexpression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1). The disease often manifests in children or young adults, with a grim prognosis that sees up to 70% and 78.7% of patients succumbing by ages 45 and 55, respectively.</p> <p>Current treatment options, including targeted therapies and conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy, have shown limited efficacy and durability, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches.</p> A Path Forward <p>Rigosertib, a legacy Traws Pharma oncology asset, is now being positioned for further development and commercialization as part of the company\u2019s broader commitment to advancing solutions for rare and challenging diseases.</p> <p>\u201cWe are excited to report the compelling efficacy and tolerability profile of rigosertib in this devastating, difficult-to-treat disease, and thank the patients, sponsors, and investigators for their commitment to this program,\u201d said Iain Dukes, MA, DPhil, Interim CEO of Traws Pharma. \u201cRigosertib is available for further development and commercialization, and we are committed to finding an appropriate partner to advance this important medicine to approval.\u201d</p> Broader Implications <p>The publication of this data not only highlights the potential of rigosertib but also shines a light on the critical need for innovation in the treatment of rare cancers.

        "Body": "<img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6QDy\" /><p>We spend roughly a third of our lives asleep, yet how often do we truly consider the mechanics of our slumber? Beyond simply finding a comfortable spot, the position we choose to rest in can have a profound impact on our overall health. While back and stomach sleepers have their own preferences, an increasing body of scientific evidence suggests that for a significant number of people, sleeping on their side might just be the secret to a more restorative night and a healthier day.</p>  <p>\"Sleep position isn't a one-size-fits-all scenario, but for many, side sleeping offers a compelling suite of benefits that address common health concerns,\" explains Dr. Anya Sharma, a sleep specialist and neurologist. \"It's not just about comfort; it's about optimizing physiological functions during those crucial hours of rest.\"</p>  <p>So, why might side sleeping be particularly advantageous for some individuals? Let's dive into the fascinating reasons:</p>  <p><strong>Aiding Digestion:</strong></p>  <p>The Benefit: For those prone to heartburn, acid reflux, or general digestive discomfort, sleeping on the left side can be particularly beneficial. The stomach's natural position means that sleeping on the left side helps keep stomach acid contained, preventing it from flowing back up into the esophagus.</p><p>Why it works: Gravity plays a helpful role here, encouraging food and stomach acid to stay put, leading to less nocturnal reflux.</p><p><strong>Reducing Snoring and Sleep Apnea:</strong></p>  <p>The Benefit: Side sleeping is often the first recommendation for individuals who snore or suffer from mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.</p><p>Why it works: When you sleep on your back, gravity can cause your tongue and soft palate to collapse to the back of your throat, obstructing your airway and leading to snoring or breathing pauses. Side sleeping helps keep the airway open, allowing for smoother, quieter breathing.</p><p>Benefiting Brain Health (Especially for the Glymphatic System):</p>  <p>The Benefit: Emerging research suggests that side sleeping might be the most efficient position for the brain's \"glymphatic system\" to clear waste products. This system is crucial for removing toxins, including amyloid-beta proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Why it works: Studies on animals suggest that the side-sleeping position allows for more effective \"flushing\" of cerebral waste products from the brain compared to back or stomach sleeping, potentially supporting long-term neurological health.</p><p><strong>Improving Circulation (Especially During Pregnancy):</strong></p>  <p>The Benefit: For pregnant individuals, sleeping on the left side is highly recommended. It improves circulation for both the mother and the baby by taking pressure off the liver and facilitating optimal blood flow to the uterus, kidneys, and heart.</p><p>Why it works: This position prevents the uterus from pressing on the vena cava, a major vein that carries blood back to the heart from the lower body.</p><p><strong>Alleviating Back and Neck Pain:</strong></p>  <p>The Benefit: For some, side sleeping, with proper pillow support, can help maintain the natural alignment of the spine, reducing pressure on the back and neck.</p><p>Why it works: When aligned correctly (with a pillow between the knees and one supporting the head), the side-sleeping position keeps the spine neutral, preventing unnatural curves and relieving tension.</p><p><strong>Reducing Joint Pain:</strong></p>  <p>The Benefit: Side sleeping can be gentler on certain joints compared to stomach sleeping, which can strain the neck and lower back.</p><p>Why it works: While specific joint pain may require careful pillow placement, the overall support offered by a well-aligned side position can be more comfortable than other positions for many.</p><p>Tips for a Better Side-Sleeping Experience:</p>  <p><strong>If you're considering making the switch or optimizing your current side-sleeping routine, here are a few friendly tips:</strong></p>  <p>Pillow Power: Invest in a good quality pillow that keeps your head and neck aligned with your spine. It should fill the gap between your ear and shoulder.</p><p>Knee Pillow: Place a small pillow between your knees. This prevents your top leg from pulling your spine out of alignment and also supports your hips.</p><p>Body Pillow: A full-body pillow can offer additional support and comfort, especially for pregnant individuals or those needing extra cushioning.</p><p>Mattress Firmness: A medium-firm mattress is generally ideal for side sleepers, offering both support and cushioning to cradle the body's curves.</p><p>While sleep position is a personal choice, understanding the compelling benefits of side sleeping might just be the nudge you need to try it out. A little adjustment could lead to a world of difference in your health and how refreshed you feel each morning. Sweet dreams!</p>",

A Persistent Feeling of Being On-Edge Around Someone</h3><p>This cue is subtle but important. If someone is using you, you might find yourself constantly waiting for the next request or feeling like you can\u2019t relax because you\u2019re accustomed to stretching your boundaries for that person.\u00a0</p><p>\"[It's] a sign that your nervous system is picking up cues and is on high alert,\" says Dr. Harrison. \"While you may not be consciously aware... [they] have put you on hyper-alert status and this fight-or-flight signal is priming you to take notice. While many givers are pros at overriding their internal awareness, your soul is begging you to take notice and recalibrate how much energy you can actually afford to expend on this person.\"</p><h3>2. A Constant Need To Please, Accommodate or Feel Validated by Someone</h3><p>Most \"users\" thrive on using their charming nature to exploit those around them. If you find yourself <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/how-being-a-people-pleaser-can-ruin-your-relationships-according-to-therapists\">constantly needing to please</a> or wanting to feel validated by a specific person, then this could be a sign they're using you.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"One of the most cunning aspects of a user\u2019s personality is their ability to use their intuition to turn you against yourself and make you completely dependent upon their approval,\" Dr. Harrison explains. \"This disavowal of self occurs because the giver has grown so accustomed to abdicating their personal power in the service of others.\" </p><p>She says that if this was in a \"humanitarian context,\" your actions might be considered \"pure gold.\" But when it comes to being used, it's \"wasted currency.\" Giving to someone who constantly expects from you will make you feel worse and worse in the long run.</p><p>\"Not only do you have the right to put yourself first and to be affirmed for being the uniquely beautiful heart that you are, but you also need to know that your limitless capacity for giving is being validated. Just not by whom you think,\" she shares.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/how-to-validate-someones-feelings\">How To Validate Someone's Feelings, According to a Clinical Psychologist</a></strong></p><h3>3. Your Needs Go Unanswered and You Feel Invisible</h3><p>If you feel like your relationship is constantly one-sided and your needs aren't being addressed at all, Dr. Harrison says this could be a sign that someone doesn't have your best interests at heart.\u00a0</p><p>\"Users are famous for disappearing and only reappearing when they want something from you,\u201d she explains. \"They groom you into being at their beck and call at a moment's notice and then react to your needs with indifference at best and ghosting, at worst. All the while, you conveniently forget about numerous disappointments and times they have let you down.\" </p><p>Relationships should be a give-and-take situation, with equal parts on both sides. So she shares that practicing generosity \"shouldn't leave you feeling drained\" and you shouldn't feel \"selfish for having a need\" or \"less important.\" If you feel \"generally depleted\" by giving into your user's needs but never having yours met, this is a sign you're being exploited.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/white-knight-syndrome\">6 Signs of 'White Knight Syndrome'\u2014Plus, How To Respond, According to a Psychologist</a></strong></p><h3>4. You Make Your Circle Smaller To Have More Energy for One Dysfunctional Person</h3><p>This is another subtle sign that you\u2019re investing too much time in a user. If you find that you\u2019re making less time for other important relationships in your life in favor of one single person, they\u2019re using too much of your energy.\u00a0And they absolutely know they're doing this to you too.</p><p>\"Users follow a common playbook,\" Dr. Harrisons says. \"It\u2019s actually uncanny how they seem to learn the same script.\"</p><p>So because there is an innate \"need\" in us to \"keep trying harder until we \u2018get it right,'\" users know this and prey on it. </p><p>\"The inordinate time and energy investment demanded from users puts the rest of our relationships out of balance,\" she explains. \"The abuser knows this and uses it to their advantage when they see you make them a larger part of your world\u2014effectively eclipsing the [inner] voice that has your well-being and mental health [in mind]. This allows the abuser to become one of your main sources of support which, ironically, flips the entire notion of support on its head.\"</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/do-narcissists-know-what-they-are-doing\">Do Narcissists Know What They\u2019re Doing? Psychologists Share the Truth</a></strong></p><h3>5. You Become Extremely Self-Critical and Emotionally Dysregulated</h3><p>We all deal with some degree of negative self-talk at times, but if you notice that you're more self-critical than usual and feeling off balance, it may be a sign someone in your life isn\u2019t good for you.\u00a0</p><p>\"When our boundaries are violated and we feel shut down, we [sometimes] engage in more numbing or self-destructive behaviors,\" Dr. Harrison explains. \"[You may also] feel the internal stagnation which manifests as depression, anxiety and panic. Doubting our most beautiful attributes and exchanging those wonderful qualities for self-loathing and deprecation is an insult to our essence. Lowering your self-worth only empowers the user.\"</p><p>There is no cure-all, but a few \"antidotes\" to help with this include \"self-reflection [and] engaging in powerful moments of healthy connection and hope and faith in the future.\" Looking forward to something in the distance, and telling yourself there's good to come helps with the damage users do.</p><p>\"This future-striving fuels post-traumatic growth and is in direct contrast with the <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/future-faking\">future-faking</a> and trail of broken promises that users excel at making,\" she explains.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/phrases-to-disarm-your-inner-critic\">35 Phrases to Disarm Your Inner Critic, According to Therapists</a></strong></p><h3>6. You Avoid Reminders and Connections of and to the User</h3><p>This may be more of a subconscious thing, but Dr. Harrison says that this is a key sign your relationship with someone isn\u2019t on solid ground.</p><p>\"In a last-ditch attempt for emotional survival, your internal cues will protest through passive resistance by making you almost amnestic to any ties to the user,\u201d she says. \"This is a form of 'magical thinking,' like a child pretending to be an ostrich by burying his head in a pile of blankets. The most problematic aspect of this approach is that cues are ubiquitous and trying to avoid them means avoiding most other aspects of your life as well. Understandably, the user then intensifies their efforts to be seen.\"</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/phrases-to-disarm-manipulative-people-according-to-psychologists\">8 Genius Comebacks for Dealing With a Manipulator, According to Psychologists</a></strong></p><h2>Common Tactics 'Users' Employ</h2><p>Dr. Harrison explains that users often rely on manipulation, excessive flattery and praise to get someone to emotionally invest in them. </p><p>They will often become angry if you refuse to do something for them, employing tactics like guilt-tripping, twisting facts and <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/gaslighting-phrases\">gaslighting</a> to keep you under their thumb.\u00a0</p><p>Users also often play the victim to elicit sympathy and will take advantage of your kindness and willingness to help.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/phrases-high-level-gaslighers-often-use-according-to-psychologists\">8 Phrases High-Level Gaslighters Often Use, According to Psychologists</a></strong></p><h2>2 Common Reasons Why People Use Others</h2><p>While there are many reasons why people use others, Dr. Harrison shares a couple of the most common.</p><h3>1. Bad Early Attachment Styles</h3><p>\"There are myriad unmet needs which cause some people to use or exploit others,\" she explains. \"Some of the more overt psychological explanations include adverse early attachment failures and disruptions\u2014especially during separation-individuation phases of childhood development.\" </p><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/traits-of-people-never-complimented-in-childhood-according-to-psychologists\">People Who Were Rarely Complimented as Children Often Develop These 10 Traits as Adults, Psychologists Say</a></strong></p><h3>2. Fundamental Needs Weren't Met in Development</h3><p>In a similar vein, Dr. Harrison says that instability can really mess up children and lead to someone becoming a user as an adult.</p><p>\"Critical caregiving which would impart security, stability and consistent reliability was replaced with inconsistency and conditionality,\" she explains. \"These fundamental needs, which were misattuned to, express themselves in deep insecurity and a false self [that 's] built on grandiosity and self-importance.\" </p><p>Despite that, there is hope in trying to reform someone who grew into a person who uses others.</p><p>\"Becoming open and aware by learning from insight-oriented experiences can help get the user more in touch with the origins of their taking behavior,\" she says. \"But by adulthood, they have often created a relationship style around getting these unmet needs met through endlessly-giving individuals. The problem is, unless this healing is attempted in professional settings accompanied by a deep desire to grow and re-align, it becomes an exercise in futility on both parts.\"</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/phrases-to-shut-down-gaslighting-according-to-psychologists\">14 Genius Phrases To Shut Down Gaslighting, According to Psychologists</a></strong></p><h2>The Impact Being Used Has on Your Mental Health</h2><p>Being used, especially in a long-term setting, can deeply impact your mental health. Dr. Harrison says it\u2019s easy to start beating yourself up for allowing yourself to be used which can lead to more negative self-talk down the line\u2014even after breaking free from the user.</p><p>\"The meaning we ascribe to our suffering makes all the difference in our ability to re-frame and handle whatever occurs,\" she says. \"When one has repeatedly been a cheerful giver and the taking by others never seems to have an end, those with a self-preservative bias might say, 'Fool me once, but not again' whereas another might respond by happily turning the other cheek. The actual response is idiosyncratic; it varies greatly [from] person to person.\"</p><p>As with many things, it's all about what you do with your situation. </p><p>\"The important aspect is the attribution or meaning we give our behavior,\" she says. \"The challenge becomes in stringing the events together to start to notice a pattern. We can then decide whether this pattern is in the service of our well-being and personal growth or not.\"</p><h2>How To Avoid Being Used</h2><p>Being aware of the above signs is the first step in avoiding a user. <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/how-to-use-emotional-intelligence-against-narcissist-according-to-psychologists\">Using your inner compass</a> and looking out for the common tactics users employ to get you on the hook are key here. Dr. Harrison says there are truly no hard and fast rules in the process, but she has a few tips.</p><p>\"It all starts with knowing your personal setpoint and listening to your deep soul signaling,\" she shares. \"We are sometimes in the habit of overriding our intuition and allowing others to transgress our boundaries. It is part of the give and take, ebb and flow of sorting a new relationship.\" </p><p>She explains that for some people, it can be hard to \"understand and grasp\" the fact that <a href=\"https://parade.com/1341134/jessicasager/physical-symptoms-burnout/\">constantly putting others first</a> (at your own expense) saps their energy and harms them in the long run. On the flip side, she notes that \"becoming reflexively self-preservative crowds out room for growth.\" </p><p>\"Both interfere with the process of becoming the highest version of oneself,\" Dr. Harrison shares. \"Becoming aware of your personal patterns and <a href=\"https://parade.com/living/boundary-phrases\">establishing boundaries</a> which preserve your core starts with awareness and a strict belief that you matter first.\"</p><p><strong>Up Next:</strong></p><p align=\"center\"><strong><a href=\"https://parade.com/living/echoism\">Related: 6 'Echoism' Phrases You May Use Without Even Realizing It, According to a Psychologist</a></strong></p><h2>Source</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://soulwisesolutions.com/about-the-author\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Kirsten Viola Harrison</a>, trauma psychologist and spiritual integration expert</li></ul>",

Between 2007 and 2016, a total of 140 deaths happened due to unintentional drowning. Half of them were in natural bodies of water \u2014 like creeks, lakes or rivers \u2014 while 25% of them were in swimming pools.</p>    <p>It\u2019s why first responders are highlighting the life-saving power of CPR and of an automated external defibrillator, or AED. </p>    <p>Captain Trevor Stokes with Travis County Emergency Services District No. 2, otherwise known as the Pflugerville Fire Department, joined KXAN\u2019s Will DuPree and Avery Travis to mark CPR and AED Awareness Week.</p>    <p><strong><em>Read a full transcription of the interview below, or watch in the video player above. Some responses were edited for clarity.</em></strong></p>    <p><strong>Avery Travis:</strong> We know this week is really meant to highlight how people can save lives and be safe out on the water. But let\u2019s talk about the issue of drowning. How big of a problem is it in Central Texas? I think a lot of folks growing up in this area learned to swim growing up, or were around swimming pools or the lake. Why might that knowledge maybe make us a little lax about the risks of drowning.</p>    <p><strong>Captain Trevor Stokes:</strong> So the biggest issue we see is obviously for children, so we recommend putting all the efforts into prevention. Obviously, knowing CPR is a good thing, but at that point, something\u2019s already happened. So drowning is silent. It\u2019s deadly, and it happens very quickly. So when enjoying water, especially in pools or even an open body of water, like we saw with the incident there at Lake Austin or Town Lake, is having a PFD, wearing a PFD, not just having it near you, but actually wearing it despite your ability to swim. That\u2019s a preventative measure. People typically don\u2019t drown when they\u2019re wearing a PFD. They surface to the top of the water. But more importantly, with kiddos, always having somebody who is watching the children, and then rotating that person regularly. So that\u2019s not someone who\u2019s reading a book, who\u2019s on their phone, they\u2019re not distracted, they\u2019re watching. Also, if you\u2019re in a pool, or if you\u2019re in a body of water where visibility is good, having a swimsuit that is not the same color as, say, the bottom of the pool. So that at any moment a kid slips below the surface, you immediately can recognize that. But rotating that person and making sure they understand what their responsibilities are prevents it. Also having likes or any prevention mechanisms so people can\u2019t wander off to the water, wander off to the pool, unaided or unassisted or even unwatched, that\u2019s a big thing.</p>    <p><strong>Will DuPree:</strong> Okay, so those are lots of things that people can keep in mind for sure. But if an emergency should happen, obviously calling 911, is important, but so is the importance of someone being a bystander who can jump in and perform CPR. What\u2019s the impact that can have on potentially saving someone\u2019s life?</p>    <p><strong>Stokes:</strong> So having knowledge of doing CPR and immediately starting that process while someone is calling 911 \u2014 it raises the potential for a save so much higher. CPR is an easy skill to learn. Anyone can do it. You can go to pflugervillefire.org. Actually, the Pflugerville Firefighters Association has a free class that goes on monthly. All the information is on our website. There\u2019s also a playlist that will help you remember the tempo. But early compressions, early CPR is the best chance to make that a survivable event.</p>    <p><strong>Travis:</strong> I think we even have that playlist pulled up so we can give it a scroll and let people see some of the songs you guys are actually trying to make this, you know, even entertaining and catchy, something easy for people to remember and learn and kind of put those skills into practice. I saw a Sabrina Carpenter song on there, and so I\u2019ll be practicing my CPR to that later today. So we\u2019re showing that resource for people and where you can find it. But I do want to ask for someone who the thought of jumping in as a bystander might be really scary, even if they\u2019ve practiced, even if they\u2019ve learned the skills. What would you say to folks, who you know that\u2019s a scary moment, to jump in and try to do something like that, if you\u2019ve only ever practiced, maybe on a practice dummy or in a class?</p>    <p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Well, it\u2019s interesting. We\u2019re doing Stillwater training right now at Lake Pflugerville. Last year, while we were out there doing that, someone actually started drowning while we were there. So as first responders, we\u2019re trained to do that. But even that group had a little hesitation, because they\u2019re like, surely, this is not happening right in front of us. So even for trained professionals, it can be stressful. The reality, though, is paying attention, making sure that someone is always watching, especially with kiddos, we can prevent that from ever happening.</p>    <p><strong>DuPree:</strong> We mentioned a little bit earlier about the device known as an AED, talk to us about what that is and how helpful it can be in an emergency.</p>    <p><strong>Stokes:</strong> So an AED is an automated external defibrillator, so it\u2019s a piece of equipment that has become very popular in public places all across the world. You\u2019ll see them in malls. You\u2019ll see them in airports. The way they\u2019re designed now is you don\u2019t need any training in them. As a matter of fact, some of the manufacturers prefer you don\u2019t have some training on, say, another brand, and then have to use that from the time you turn it on, it will walk you through every single step. Those that are located near a pool or a body of water \u2014 there\u2019s very specific directions drawing the person off before you do it. But other than that, it allows the best chance to restart the heart, should it be an electrical issue.</p>     <i>Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

From 2014 to 2024, the department lists just six cases.</p> <p>Though the risk to others in the store at the time was low, the county asks anyone who is not vaccinated or who is immunocompromised to contact the Communicable Disease Team at 970-400-2223 for a risk assessment.</p> <p>Regardless of vaccination or immune-system status, anyone who may have been at the King Soopers during that timeframe should watch for symptoms until June 20, according to the release.</p> <p>Symptoms typically begin similarly to a cold and can include fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. A few days later, a red, blotchy rash will appear, usually starting on the face and neck before spreading to the rest of the body, the county said.</p> <p>A person is considered infectious up to four days before the rash appears, according to the release.</p> <p>The county urges people who show symptoms to isolate and reach out to their primary doctor or an urgent care facility to possibly be tested. It is important to notify the health care provider of the possible exposure so staff can take proper precautions.</p> <p>The county also encourages those who are unvaccinated \u2014 or unsure of their vaccination status \u2014 to call the Department of Public Health and Environment\u2019s Public Health Clinic at 970-400-6420 to discuss options.</p> <p>For more information about measles, including vaccination recommendations and Colorado exposure locations, visit <a href=\"http://CDPHE.Colorado.Gov/DCPHR/Measles-Information\">CDPHE.Colorado.Gov/DCPHR/Measles-Information</a>.</p> <p><i>\u00a9 2025 the Greeley Tribune (Greeley, Colo.).

They are not a quick fix to lose weight and have not been assessed to be safe when used in this way,\" Dr Alison Cave, MHRA chief safety officer, said.</p><p>\"Our guidance offers patients a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for our up-to-date advice on how to use these powerful medicines safely,\"\u00a0she said.</p><p>\"This guidance should not be used as a substitute to reading the patient information leaflet or having a conversation with a healthcare professional as part of the prescribing process.\"</p><p>The latest guidance also reminds patients taking jabs of the symptoms to look out for in the event of acute pancreatitis which, although uncommon, can be serious.</p><p>The main symptom is severe pain in the stomach that radiates to the back and does not go away, and people should seek immediate medical help.</p><p>GLP-1 or GLP-1 RAs help people feel fuller by mimicking a natural hormone released after eating.</p><p>Some, like Mounjaro, also act on a second hormone involved in appetite and blood sugar control.</p><p>\"Pharmacists urge women taking GLP-1 medicines to note this important new guidance from the MHRA published today and use effective contraception,\" Jasmine Shah, medication safety officer at the National Pharmacy Association, said.</p><p>\"Community pharmacies have been experiencing unprecedented levels of interest for weight loss injections,\"\u00a0she said.</p><p>\"It is therefore important that regulations and guidance keep pace with this demand and that patient safety is put at the heart of everything we do.\"</p>",

In mid-April, the advisers had discussed the possibility of narrowing the recommendations for who should receive an annual COVID vaccine -- prioritizing those at higher risk such as adults over 65 or those with an underlying condition. </p> <p> Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rfk-jr-cuts-covid-vaccine-recommendation-healthy-kids/story?id=122233770\">announced the removal of COVID vaccines</a> from the immunization schedule for healthy children and healthy pregnant women. </p> <p> Later on Friday, the CDC updated the immunization schedule allowing all children to be eligible to receive COVID vaccines, now under a shared clinical decision-making model, which means parents can choose to get their children vaccinated with the advice of a doctor.</p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/healthy-children-vaccination-rfk-jr-cuts-covid-shot/story?id=122303993\">MORE: Why healthy children may need vaccination as RFK Jr. cuts COVID shot recommendation for some kids</a> <p> The mixed messages prompted concern from some medical organizations. </p> <p> \"American families deserve better,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said, in part, in a statement. \"They deserve clear messages from all involved in their health, that are based on facts so they can continue to benefit from the success story of vaccines.\" </p> <p> The statement went on to say: \"While the shared clinical decision-making model in the updated immunization schedule preserves families' choice, this model has consistently proven challenging to implement because it lacks clear guidance for the conversations between a doctor and a family. Doctors and families need straightforward, evidence-based guidance, not vague, impractical frameworks,\" the AAP statement added. </p> <p> Pregnant women were left without a recommendation on the CDC's immunization schedule as to whether or not to receive the COVID vaccine. </p> <p> Despite the change in recommendations from HHS, \"the science has not changed,\" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said in part of a statement. \"It is very clear that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants after birth,\" the ACOG statement added.</p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/300-people-us-dying-covid-week/story?id=122068959\">MORE: Why are more than 300 people in the US still dying from COVID every week?</a> <p> Federal officials had made the changes to the vaccine recommendations without the input of the CDC's independent panel of vaccine advisers and before their meeting set for late June, according to the public calendar. In the meeting, advisers were set to discuss their recommendation for who should be eligible for COVID vaccines including a vote on whether to narrow the recommendations. </p><p> \"Governmental guidance about vaccines is an important foundation that enables insurance coverage of\u2014and therefore access to\u2014vaccines, so changing government recommendations about which specific and limited populations should receive COVID-19 vaccines has far-reaching consequences,\" the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) said in part of a statement. </p><p> Some medical and public health organizations had expressed concerns at the officials' change to vaccine recommendations without the input of independent advisers. </p><p> \"Federal vaccine recommendations have traditionally been developed by medical and public health experts who gather openly to review evidence and receive public input before recommending what vaccines are needed and who should be eligible for them. Conclusions are based on the best available science, and recommendations are communicated with precision and clarity, providing guidance to clinicians to make the best decisions with their patients,\" part of the IDSA statement read. </p>",

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), about 30 percent of first responders develop <a href=\"https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/therapy-chat-gpt-ai-mental-health-expert-concerns\" rel=\"noopener\">mental health</a> conditions like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p><p>June is recognized nationally as PTSD Awareness Month. The <a href=\"https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/southcenter-mall-possible-shots-fired\" rel=\"noopener\">Tukwila Police Department</a> is using this time to focus on the issue affecting officers locally and across the country.</p><p>In an announcement, the department wrote, \"By empowering law enforcement officers to recognize the symptoms, intervene early on and seek help, we can help curb and treat the impact of these traumatic events as soon as possible before they become too great a weight and burden to bear.\"</p><strong>Dig deeper</strong><p>NAMI reports that most first responders don\u2019t get the help they need due to concern for personal and professional consequences. Robert Cubby, a retired captain from the Jersey City Police Department, was once one of them.</p><p>\"There\u2019s just too many first responders right now that are not seeking help and it\u2019s sad that they\u2019re sitting and not getting the help they need,\" said Cubby, now a NAMI facilitator on PTSD.</p><p>Tukwila Police Department is working to break the stigma to support its officers. TPD announced officers will wear a patch all month long highlighting the issue of PTSD as part of its rotating patch program.</p><img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6X4X\"><p>Officers will also receive education from the department\u2019s officer wellness program. They will learn about signs of PTSD, promote early intervention, and provide resources for impacted officers.\u00a0</p><p>Cubby, the retired New Jersey captain, candidly told NAMI about the symptoms he experienced before seeking help for his PTSD.\u00a0</p><p>\"In one instance, I felt like, they call it sleep paralysis, that someone was laying on my chest and I couldn\u2019t move, I couldn\u2019t breathe, and I couldn\u2019t stop them. And that was terrifying, it was absolutely unbelievably horrifying,\" said Cubby.</p><p>Law enforcement officers are at a high risk of experiencing traumatic events on a regular basis that can lead to PTSD. Those events include the death investigation of three young sisters from Wenatchee murdered allegedly by their father, Travis Decker. The girls\u2019 bodies were found at the Rock Island Campground near Leavenworth, according to Chelan County investigators.</p><p>In recognizing this awareness month, TPD\u2019s statement read, in part, \"PTSD impacts everyone different. For officers with children, handling traumatic incidents involving kids can lead to PTSD.\"</p><p>The department further stated, \"Emotionally impactful incidents involving death investigations or other emotionally charged events can also trigger PTSD.\"</p><p>There is help available. For Cubby, it was contacting NAMI about his traumatic memories on the force.</p><p>\"With PTSD, it\u2019s not something that you\u2019re cured of. There\u2019s no cure for PTSD.

And guess what, this time, it\u2019s again about a Porsche. So, what started as a light-hearted gag in May 2024, when Ohtani gifted Roberts a miniature toy car as a joke, has now turned into an ongoing locker room saga. Nearly a year later, Roberts finally found the perfect moment for a payback. And, he made sure it was the payback Ohtani wouldn\u2019t forget.</p> <p>Well, the story began last year when Ohtani promised to gift Roberts a car once he surpassed the mark for most home runs by a Japanese player in Dodgers history. True to his word, Ohtani delivered. But the car that he gifted to Roberts turned out to be a toy that fit neatly in the palm of the manager\u2019s hand. It was a well-delivered prank by the Japanese ace.</p> <p>Then came round two. In March this year, Roberts approached what he thought was his car in the parking lot, only to find yet another miniature Porsche sitting in the spot. Here again, Ohtani had pulled off a flawless prank. So, after two strikes against him, a payback from Roberts was inevitable. And finally, he got his moment.</p> <p>While this saga is far from over, the manager has now officially joined the scoreboard. \u201c<em>Doc and his wife bought Shohei\u2019s daughter a brand new car\u2026kind of</em>,\u201d the Dodgers\u2019 official Instagram account wrote while sharing a clip that showed a remote-controlled pink Porsche Roberts and his wife had brought for Ohtani\u2019s daughter.</p> <p>Just when Ohtani visited his room, Roberts offered him the gift. Well, all Ohtani could do was smile, as this time, it was him who got pranked. <em>\u201cThis is from my wife and me to you and your family and your daughter. So we have jokes always, but this is a little bit of a joke,\u201d</em> Roberts chuckled.<p><strong>Trending Articles</strong></p><div><ul>          <li><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-savage-derek-jeter-makes-feeling-known-about-juan-soto-s-yankees-exit-as-a-rod-divulges-concerning-loop/?utm_source=msn_trending_post&utm_medium=msn&utm_campaign=msn_trending_1\">           Savage Derek Jeter Makes Feeling Known About Juan Soto\u2019s Yankees Exit as A-Rod Divulges Concerning Loop</a></li>                   <li><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-miami-marlins-set-embarrassing-mlb-record-with-fewer-fans-in-attendance-than-a-half-capacity-boeing-seven-four-seven/?utm_source=msn_trending_post&utm_medium=msn&utm_campaign=msn_trending_2\">           Miami Marlins Set Embarrassing MLB Record With Fewer Fans in Attendance Than a Half Capacity Boeing 747</a></li>                   <li><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-derek-jeters-yankees-were-terrified-of-scary-red-sox-legend-reveals-alex-rodriguez-in-bombshell-confession-david-ortiz/?utm_source=msn_trending_post&utm_medium=msn&utm_campaign=msn_trending_3\">           Derek Jeter\u2019s Yankees Were Terrified of Scary Red Sox Legend, Reveals Alex Rodriguez in Bombshell Confession</a></li>         </ul></div></p> <div><span data-embed-type=\"social-auto\" data-embed-id=\"8bcca66b37834bc2ac50d5919470b797\"></span></div>  <p>But was it only a prank? The answer is NO! It was more than just a prank. It was more about Roberts\u2019 gift to Ohtani\u2019s daughter. <em>\u201cThis will be your daughter\u2019s first car,\u201d</em> the manager added.</p> <p>This prank saga, the scoreline of which is now 2-1, shows a healthy culture in the Dodgers\u2019 clubhouse. And, the timing for this banter could not be better than this, when Ohtani is leading the hitting chart in the league.</p> <h2><strong>Shohei Ohtani eyes consecutive MVP this year</strong></h2> <p>The current form of <span>Shohei </span>Ohtani is nothing but deserving of a berth among the MVP nominees this year. Just when this season kicked in, there was a broad discussion about when Ohtani would come out of the slump. He was not hitting homers, and his power was not quite there. Well, the tables have turned now!</p> <p>Currently, <span>Ohtani is delivering <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/discover-feed/mlb-baseball-news-aaron-judge-shohei-ohtani-explode-in-series-opener-after-yankees-manager-declares-superior-hitter-in-mvp-clash/?utm_source=msn_article&utm_medium=msn\" rel=\"noopener\">another standout season</a> at the plate for the Dodgers.</span> <span>In 59 games, he boasts a .288 BA, with 23 home runs, 39 RBIs, and 64 runs scored.</span> <span>His OPS stands at an impressive 1.039, ranking third in the league.</span></p> <p>But while Ohtani is showing his vintage style with his hitting, the Dodgers are yet to get him on the mound. But guess what, that unfulfilled wish of the fans is about to be fulfilled. Ohtani is facing hitters in the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen session, and his recovery from TJ surgery is going as planned.</p> <p>Reportedly, he is just a month away from<a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/discover-feed/mlb-baseball-news-dodgers-manager-makes-major-shohei-ohtani-pitching-reveal-after-latest-live-bp-sparks-massive-buzz/?utm_source=msn_article&utm_medium=msn\" rel=\"noopener\"> throwing fireballs in a live game</a>. Maybe the Dodgers are keeping Ohtani for the postseason. Another MVP for the Japanese ace might be around the corner with hitting going as expected, and pitching on the way.</p> <p>It will be fair to say Shohei Ohtani is offering the same punch that you get while driving a Porsche.</p> <p><img data-reference=\"video\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/video/AA1wX3dm\"></p> <p><strong>Related Articles</strong></p><div><ul>          <li><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-dave-roberts-drops-concerning-mookie-betts-injury-update-ahead-of-yankees-dodgers-series-opener/?utm_source=msn_related_post&utm_medium=msn&utm_campaign=msn_related_1\">           Dave Roberts Drops Concerning Mookie Betts Injury Update Ahead of Yankees-Dodgers Series Opener</a></li>                   <li><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-after-thrilling-win-dave-roberts-compares-shohei-ohtani-with-mlb-legend-in-massive-praise-for-dodgers-star/?utm_source=msn_related_post&utm_medium=msn&utm_campaign=msn_related_2\">           After Thrilling Win Dave Roberts Compares Shohei Ohtani With MLB Legend in Massive Praise for\u00a0Dodgers\u00a0Star</a></li>                   <li><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-crisis-hits-dodgers-as-three-sixty-five-m-ace-rued-out-from-tokyo-series-due-to-illness/?utm_source=msn_related_post&utm_medium=msn&utm_campaign=msn_related_3\">           Crisis Hits Dodgers as $365M Ace Ruled Out from Tokyo Series Due to Illness</a></li>                   <li><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-dave-roberts-confirms-yet-another-crushing-blow-to-dodgers-title-defence-amid-mookie-betts-injury/?utm_source=msn_related_post&utm_medium=msn&utm_campaign=msn_related_4\">           Dave Roberts Confirms Yet Another Crushing Blow to Dodgers Title Defence Amid Mookie Betts Injury</a></li>                   <li><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-dave-roberts-reveals-shohei-ohtanis-pitching-return-timeline-in-massive-update-amid-dodgers-injury-crisis/?utm_source=msn_related_post&utm_medium=msn&utm_campaign=msn_related_5\">           Dave Roberts Reveals Shohei Ohtani\u2019s Pitching Return Timeline in Massive Update Amid Dodgers Injury Crisis</a></li>         </ul></div><p>Like our content? <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/channel/source/EssentiallySports/sr-vid-694nvkuvfe3bdfv9yus59yxx7i9ex04w6maieuqutv2h24uu2bna\">Follow us</a> for more. </p>",

(WTAP) - With the start of summer, you might be getting ready to spend some more time outside in the warm weather, but if you plan on doing this with your pets, there are a few things you need to keep in mind to ensure their safety in the summer heat. </p><p>According to Dr. Jacob Kay, Associate Veterinarian at the St. Marys Veterinary Clinic, there are a few symptoms to be mindful of when playing with your pets outside. </p><p>Some of the common signs of heatstroke in pets include: </p><ul><li>Excessive panting\u00a0</li><li>Drooling\u00a0</li><li>lethargy or weakness\u00a0</li><li>Vomiting\u00a0</li><li>Diarrhea\u00a0</li><li>Change in gum color (blue-gray or bright red)\u00a0</li><li>Muscle tremors\u00a0</li><li>Abnormal gait (incoordination)\u00a0</li><li>Seizures\u00a0</li><li>Sudden collapse\u00a0</li></ul><p> Dr. Kay says that once you start to notice early symptoms that the first and best thing you can do is take them to a cool area and try to lower their temperature slowly. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different methods that people have tried and recommended a lot of times. Just a cool damp towel, laying that on them, especially on their feet or the back of their neck. They actually make those dry towels now that you pretty much pour water on them and you can snap it, and it\u2019ll have a cooling effect so you can place a couple of those on them, those are nice to have around for humans and dogs. Then at that point, if you\u2019re still concerned or you\u2019re not seeing any improvement, I always recommend reaching out to your local vet.\u201d </p><p>Dr. Kay says that flat-faced dogs such as English Bulldogs and pugs, obese dogs, and dogs with cardiorespiratory diseases are at an increased risk of over-heating due to their inability to pant effectively, as this is the main way dogs will try to cool themselves down. </p><p>He iterates that heat stroke can be fatal if not treated. </p><p>\u201c...heat stroke is a really big issue. It usually happens when the dog\u2019s body temperature starts approaching 105\u00b0F. Symptoms that you kind of see is extreme excessive panting, lethargy [which means] they lay down and they start panting and breathing really rapidly, so they\u2019re breathing, and you can tell they don\u2019t feel well. Heat stroke can also lead to seizure activity, so you may see some focal seizures, meaning just a really sudden onset of pretty much shaking and tremors. It can also drop their blood glucose so they may seem like they\u2019re mentally disoriented, so they may not be with it as much as they normally would, they may not respond to their name. If you\u2019re seeing any of those symptoms, you\u2019ve got to get them into a cool area and contact a local veterinarian or emergency clinic right away because it can ultimately be fatal...\u201d </p><p>Dr. Kay also expresses protecting your pet\u2019s feet from the hot concrete or asphalt in the summer as it can burn their paws. </p><p>\u201c...my rule of thumb is if it\u2019s too hot for your bare feet, it\u2019s not safe enough for your pets, so always try to take your foot in place on the concrete. Asphalt gets hotter than concrete, usually, so definitely take a second to take your shoe off and place your foot on the ground... Try to walk them on grassier areas. You can walk on the sidewalk but allow your pet to walk on some grassier areas. Also, you can buy little booties and that will slide on the bottom of their paws that provide an extra little layer of protection, and just mitigate how long they\u2019re actually only asphalt.\u201d </p><p> He also discourages leaving your pet in the car if at all possible as temperatures can rapidly rise in cars when left unattended. </p><p>\u201cIf at all possible, and you know you\u2019re going to have to leave for an extended period of time, it\u2019s probably safer most times to leave your pet at home. Cars actually can heat up over 20\u00b0 in 10 minutes, so 65\u00b0 air conditioners can get to 85\u00b0 in less than 10 minutes, which can ultimately be crucial to the pet, and that\u2019s even with the windows down a lot of times. A lot of these newer vehicles have auto starts and things that allow your car to run longer and still lock it. If you have to, that is pretty much the ultimate option and pretty much the only option to keep your pet safe. Otherwise, I would recommend trying to leave them at home more.\u201d </p><p> Dr. Kay also encourages the use of sunscreen specifically made for pets who have lighter skin, or a thinner fur coat to protect them from the sun. </p><p><i>See an error in our reporting?

        "Body": "<p>As with most pets, guinea pigs require grooming. While long-haired guinea pigs need their hair brushed weekly, short-haired guinea pigs only need brushing a couple of times each month. Bathing a guinea pig can be beneficial, especially if it spends a lot of time in an outdoor enclosure. Nail clipping is another task on the guinea pig grooming list. While brushing and bathing are straightforward tasks, nail clipping is less so. Continue reading to learn how to trim guinea pig nails, along with how to keep your pet calm during the process, and what to do if you accidentally cut your guinea pig\u2019s nails too short.</p>    <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-trim-guinea-pig-nails\">How to Trim Guinea Pig Nails</h2>   <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6vTc\">   <p>It\u2019s helpful to examine your guinea pig\u2019s nails before you begin the nail clipping process. If your guinea pig has white or light-colored nails, it will be easy to see a thin red line inside each nail. This is a blood vessel called the quick. The quick delivers blood to this small animal\u2019s nails. If your guinea pig has black nails, shining a light close to the nail can help you locate the quick.</p>    <p>Once you see the quick, hold your guinea pig\u2019s leg firmly while placing the nail trimmer just beyond the end of the quick. If your guinea pig becomes agitated, take a break and let your pet relax a bit before trying again.</p>    <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nail-clippers\">Nail Clippers</h2>   <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6ARr\">   <p>A pair of small animal nail clippers is the best tool to use to trim your pet\u2019s nails. Small animal nail clippers have handles that are easy to grip and control. This type of clipper has a sliding blade. After putting a guinea pig\u2019s nail through the hole of the nail clipper, simply squeeze the handles together to operate the blade. Guinea pig nails are thin, so it takes but a second or two to trim each one.</p>    <p>Many guinea pig guardians use nail clippers designed to trim a cat\u2019s nails. A cat\u2019s nails and a guinea pig\u2019s nails are similar, so if you have a nail trimmer for your cat, it can double as a trimmer for your guinea pig.</p>    <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-keep-calm-and-trim-on\">Keep Calm and Trim On</h2>   <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1G6l1k\">   <p>Understandably, some guinea pigs are anxious or frightened when having their nails clipped. Fortunately, there are some ways to make the process less stressful.</p>    <p>Give the guinea pig something to munch on while it\u2019s having its nails trimmed. A few lettuce leaves, a carrot, or hay all serve as a delicious distraction for a guinea pig during the nail clipping process. As a bonus, giving a guinea pig a treat is likely to make it feel even more relaxed the next time it needs its nails trimmed.</p>    <p>Petting guinea pigs and talking to them in a soothing voice can also calm them. If you find your pet responds to music, play some. Cutting their nails while seated on the floor may make them feel more at ease than being on a table or a countertop.</p>    <p>Consider wrapping your guinea pig in a soft towel while you clip its nails. This helps the guinea pig feel more secure. Another advantage of holding your guinea pig in a towel is that it may shed some of its hair during the process. Guinea pigs, like many animals, will shed fur when they are nervous. The towel helps prevent the fur from getting on your clothing. </p>    <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nail-trimming-schedule\">Nail Trimming Schedule</h2>   <img data-reference=\"image\" data-document-id=\"cms/api/amp/image/AA1FmHFs\">   <p>As a general rule, guinea pig nails should be trimmed every two to four weeks, depending on how quickly your pet\u2019s nails grow.</p>    <p>A quick visual exam will tell you what you need to know. Are the ends starting to curl back beneath your pet\u2019s feet? This is a sure sign that their nails need clipping. When their nails get too long, they curl into their feet, which can cause pain and force the guinea pig to limp. If a guinea pig is biting or pulling at its nails, this is another sign that its nails are too long and need a trim. Biting or pulling at the nail is the pet\u2019s way of trying to solve the issue itself.</p>    <p>A regular schedule for nail clipping is important because long nails can cause injuries. If your pet\u2019s nails continue to grow, curl, and poke into the bottoms of their feet, they can become wedged inside the footpad. This is very painful for a guinea pig and requires a small animal veterinarian to remove the nail or nails. It\u2019s equally important to keep their nails clipped to prevent snagging injuries. A guinea pig can get its overly long nails caught or snagged on a piece of cloth in its habitat. When the guinea attempts to free itself, it may injure or break its nail in the process, which can lead to infection.</p>    <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cutting-too-close\">Cutting Too Close </h2>    <p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s easy to cut into the quick of a guinea pig\u2019s nail. Cutting the quick of the nail causes some bleeding and pain for the guinea pig. When this happens, these are the steps to take to stop the bleeding.</p>    <p>First, gently hold a soft cloth or paper towel up to the nail to slow the bleeding. Next, apply styptic powder to the injured nail. This is done by pouring a little of the powder into a shallow bowl and dipping the pet\u2019s nail into it. It\u2019s best to put the powder in its own bowl as opposed to trying to put the animal\u2019s nail in the actual container of styptic powder. Styptic powder makes blood vessels contract or close, effectively stopping the bleeding. Not only does it stop the bleeding, but it also helps prevent bacteria from entering the wound. Styptic powder can be found in most pet supply stores and even online.</p><h2>Follow A-Z Animals!</h2> <ul> <li>See today\u2019s latest and most exciting animal news when you follow A-Z Animals. <strong><a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/channel/source/AZ%20Animals%20US/sr-vid-7etr9q8xun6k6508c3nufaum0de3dqktiq6h27ddeagnfug30wka\">Click here to access the A-Z Animals profile page</a> </strong>and be sure to hit the\u00a0<em>Follow</em>\u00a0button here or at the top of this article!</li> <li>Have feedback?

But did you know there are three specific ways you can potentially shorten the wait time and receive help sooner?</p>  <p>If you're about to begin the application process, or you\u2019re helping someone else through it, here\u2019s what you need to know.</p>  <p><strong>1. Compassionate Allowances (CAL): Fast-Track for Serious Diagnoses</strong></p>  <p>If you or a loved one has a serious medical condition, you may qualify for the <strong>Compassionate Allowances (CAL)</strong> program, a Social Security initiative designed to speed up the disability determination process.</p>  <p>The program applies to both SSI and SSDI and includes medical conditions that automatically meet the agency\u2019s definition of disability. These are often life-threatening or severe diseases, including:</p>  <ul>   <li>Certain types of aggressive cancer</li>   <li>Adult brain disorders</li>   <li>Rare and severe pediatric conditions</li>  </ul>  <p>CAL doesn\u2019t skip any eligibility requirements, but it ensures your case gets flagged for faster review, often leading to much quicker decisions, sometimes in a matter of weeks.</p>  <p>You don't need to file a separate application to be considered; the Social Security Administration will identify potential CAL cases based on your medical records. Still, it's a good idea to mention any CAL-eligible condition when you apply. You can find the current list of CAL conditions on the Social Security website.</p>  <p><strong>2. ALS Exception: No Waiting Period for SSDI</strong></p>  <p>Normally, if you qualify for SSDI, your payments won\u2019t begin until the sixth full month after your disability begins. But there\u2019s one important exception: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.</p>  <p>Thanks to a specific law, if you are diagnosed with ALS and meet SSDI eligibility criteria, you can skip the five-month waiting period entirely. That means benefits can begin much faster, usually as soon as your application is approved.</p>  <p>If ALS is part of your diagnosis, make sure it is clearly documented in your medical records and mentioned in your application.</p>  <p><strong>3. Dire Need Payments: Emergency Help While You Wait</strong></p>  <p>Are you facing an urgent financial crisis while your claim is pending? The Social Security Administration can issue an emergency advance payment if:</p>  <ul>   <li>You\u2019re a new applicant</li>   <li>You are owed benefits that are delayed or haven't been paid</li>   <li>You\u2019re experiencing serious hardship, like being unable to pay for food, housing, or medicine</li>  </ul>  <p>These \u201cDire Need Payments\u201d are not automatic. You\u2019ll need to contact your local Social Security office, explain your situation, and request emergency consideration.</p>  <p>It\u2019s not a full solution to speed up your approval, but for some applicants, it can be a vital bridge during a period of high stress and uncertainty.</p>  <h3>What You Can Do Right Now</h3>  <ul>   <li>Research CAL-eligible conditions and discuss them with your doctor if they apply.</li>   <li>If you have ALS, make sure your diagnosis is well-documented and highlighted in your SSDI application.</li>   <li>If you're in urgent need, don\u2019t wait\u2014reach out to your local SSA office and ask about emergency support.</li>  </ul>  <p>Understanding these options won't guarantee instant approval, but they can shave weeks or even months off the process and bring peace of mind during a difficult time.</p>  <p>Need help navigating the application? Talking to a disability advocate, caseworker, or a legal aid provider can help make sure your application is complete and accurate, which also increases your chances of faster processing.</p>  <p>Check:</p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.explica.me/en/News/More-hits-to-Social-Security-from-Trump-and-DOGE-restructuring-20250603-0046.html\" rel=\"\">More hits to Social Security from Trump and DOGE restructuring</a></p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.explica.me/en/News/The-irreversible-change-in-Social-Security-payments-starting-this-June-20250603-0047.html\" rel=\"\">The irreversible change in Social Security payments starting this June</a></p>",

(WFRV) \u2013 A blistering 103-degree fever on a cool Friday night in October 2020 hit Kathy Rueckert out of the blue. Then 65 years old, the former ThedaCare administrator was healthy and active, walking five miles every day and playing pickleball competitively every week.</p>    <p>But her active lifestyle was about to be disrupted for months, and her life changed forever.</p>   <div class=\"nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text\">   <a href=\"https://www.wearegreenbay.com/news/local-news/we-are-at-crisis-level-wisconsin-humane-society-reduces-adoption-fees-as-need-for-dog-adoptions-skyrockets/?ipid=promo-link-block1\" class=\"promo-link__link\">   \u2018We are at crisis level\u2019: Wisconsin Humane Society reduces adoption fees as need for dog adoptions skyrockets </a>  </div>   <p>Rueckert could not shake the fever, and after several days, had to go to urgent care. Doctors thought it might have been an ear infection. Despite amoxicillin, other medications, and multiple trips back to urgent care, it would not resolve.</p>    <p>\u201cThe medical community was kind of perplexed by it,\u201d Rueckert said.</p>    <p>Then came Nov. 18, 2020. After blood tests, experts finally came to a conclusion. Rueckert had low platelets, needed a transfusion, and it turned out a parasite was essentially eating her blood cells.</p>    <p>Babesiosis, transmitted by the bite of a deer tick, was found in her bloodstream. Extremely uncommon, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services records fewer than 100 cases in the entire state each year.</p>    <p>\u201cThey will tell you to watch for a bullseye, but there was nothing,\u201d Rueckert said. \u201cSo this deer tick could have been just a small baby deer tick, but for me to try to find that on me\u2014and when I got it\u2014I have no idea.\u201d</p>    <p>And that was only one of two incredibly rare and serious conditions Rueckert was battling.</p>    <p>\u201cThat was on Nov. 18. I went into the ER by myself\u2014that was during COVID, so no one could come with me. And I didn\u2019t come out until Feb. 18,\u201d Rueckert said. \u201cThat day I went in, I was experiencing numbness in the foot, and it had started to progress to Guillain-Barr\u00e9. In between there, I had gotten a mild case of COVID at the end of October. So I had what I would call a trifecta that year.\u201d</p>    <p>It is unclear what caused the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome for Rueckert, but it could have been triggered by the tick bite, medications she was on for the fever, her case of COVID-19, or a combination of the three.</p>    <p>That trifecta paid out to be a rollercoaster of a hospital stay for Rueckert, with far greater downs than ups.</p>    <p>\u201cI was vented twice, then I was trached, I was on a feeding tube, I was down to 82 pounds, I came home a quadriplegic and then had to work my way back up,\u201d Rueckert said. \u201cIt was very scary and lonely, especially when you are ventilated and paralyzed and can\u2019t talk.\u201d</p>    <p>Rueckert praises ThedaCare medical staff for getting her through her time in the hospital, and then her husband, friends, and therapists once out. Working to get her mobility back was a challenging and uncertain time, but her faith kept her grounded on hoping to enjoy the small things in life that so many take for granted.</p>    <p>\u201cPlease let me stand and look out the window instead of sitting in a wheelchair. Please let me play pickleball just one more time,\u201d Rueckert would ask God.</p>    <p>Less than five months after being discharged from the hospital, Rueckert was walking with a cane, and within the year, she was back to playing pickleball\u2014her favorite sport\u2014competitively on her own.</p>    <p>\u201cI believe I\u2019m probably 85% to where I was before and am just grateful for what I can do,\u201d Rueckert said of her recovery. \u201cI did not think I\u2019d ever get to this spot today.\u201d</p>    <p>Rueckert is still doing physical therapy each week. Her balance is off at times, and muscles are not quite what they used to be. She is thankful to be where she is but still pushed to be 100%.</p>    <p>Rueckert still regularly goes to appointments to make sure the babesiosis is under control. While it is not affecting her, it technically is still in her system, and her antigen levels continue to be monitored regularly as a result.</p>    <p>Despite the immense adversity and health struggles an unknown tick bite likely caused her, Rueckert has no fear of getting back outdoors, as she frequently hikes and bikes outside.</p>    <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a fear of it, I don\u2019t like fear to control my life. However, I\u2019m a little more cautious.\u201d</p>    <p>Treating clothing and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin, wearing insect repellent, walking in the center of trails, wearing long clothes to cover as much skin as possible, and checking your body for ticks after coming indoors are all tips Rueckert follows and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend.</p>    <p>While grateful for the support and care she has received from medical professionals, she hopes there are some pieces to her journey that could be different for others. The first is going back to those uncertainty-filled weeks before she had a diagnosis, as Rueckert hopes professionals add another question to the intake survey.</p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019m usually the one that does all the research when my friends get sick, but because I was so sick I didn\u2019t research it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was talking to my sons about it. They said, \u2018One of the intake questions should have been, Are you an active outdoors person?\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>For patients who are paralyzed or do not have the ability to speak, Rueckert hopes there are improvements that can be made for patients communicating with nurses and doctors. She was given a beeper remote in the hospital bed, but if that fell on the floor, she would have no line of communication to staff until it was placed back on her lap.</p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be an advocate for tick bites, babesiosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9, and get more resources,\u201d she said.</p>    <p>Her goal one day is for a website or organization to be created to help patients post-hospital stay, to make it easier to connect with each other and find resources.</p>    <p>Rueckert has wasted no time in finding patients like her, volunteering her time at ThedaCare to talk with rare patients affected by tick bites and Guillain-Barr\u00e9.</p>    <p>\u201cYou have to have a positive attitude. You have to be a fighter. You cannot give up. You have to find that inner strength,\u201d Rueckert said.</p>   <div class=\"nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text\">   <a href=\"https://www.wearegreenbay.com/news/local-news/oshkosh-area-community-foundation-provides-1-million-in-scholarships-to-305-students/?ipid=promo-link-block2\" class=\"promo-link__link\">   Oshkosh Area Community Foundation provides $1 million in scholarships to 305 students </a>  </div>   <p>She also realizes how the disease has changed her\u2014not just physically, but in being able to see things once hidden in others.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s changed my outlook to appreciate every day.

Laborers who cut, grind, sand, finish or polish engineered stone slabs are at risk of inhaling crystalline silica dust, causing lung inflammation and scarring, which can lead to silicosis, a severe lung disease, that may cause difficulty breathing, a need for a lung transplant and even death.</p><p>The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has reported 322 cases of silicosis, 31 lung transplants and 15 deaths in the state as of May, with 180 cases (over 55%) reported in Los Angeles County. The majority of those cases are in the Northeast San Fernando Valley, where the stone fabrication industry is most prevalent.\u00a0</p><p>On Tuesday, the LA County Board of Supervisors (BOS) proclaimed June as Silicosis Awareness Month, approving the motion spearheaded by Supervisors Lindsey P. Horvath and Hilda Solis.</p><p>\u201cWe want to make sure that not only are people aware of what this what this disease is, what it does, [and] how they can get exposed to harmful conditions,\u201d said Horvath, who represents the Northeast Valley, \u201cbut also, what they can do to protect themselves, [and] what we are doing to protect their health and invest in treatment and care.\u201d</p><p>There is no cure for silicosis. Once in an advanced stage, the only treatment is a lung transplant \u2013 a complicated and expensive procedure, which may only extend someone\u2019s life by an average of six years. The majority of those suffering are young Latino men in their 30s and 40s, though even workers in their 20s are receiving transplantations.\u00a0</p><p>The city, county and state have taken steps to address the preventable disease through awareness campaigns, updated industry regulations and new legislation.\u00a0</p><p>In 2023, the BOS approved the \u201cSilicosis Prevention Education\u201d motion, which invested $500,000 in intervention outreach and education through the nonprofits Pacoima Beautiful and the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California (IDEPSCA).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re also working through the County\u2019s Department of Public Health and Department of Health Services to make sure that there\u2019s testing available,\u201d added Horvath.</p><p>Beyond education, the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) has updated the standards for fabrication shops to include wet-cutting practices, better ventilation and more protective PPE, such as respirator masks.\u00a0</p><p>LA City Councilmembers Imelda Padilla, Bob Blumenfield and Monica Rodriguez also co-introduced a set of motions in 2024, which created a mandatory wastewater permit for stone fabrication businesses and language specifying the risks of using silica products in Building and Safety construction permits.\u00a0</p><p>However, some fear that stricter regulations and costly equipment updates may push the industry out of the region or force small operations to conduct business more secretly, leaving many already vulnerable workers without a livelihood or placing them in more dangerous workplace conditions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c[For] some of these workers, this might be the only place where they\u2019ve been able to get work, and we don\u2019t want to push this work into the shadows, putting them at risk,\u201d said Horvath. \u201cWe need to make sure that [regulations are] done in such a way where people are able to have a livelihood, but they\u2019re not having to put their life at risk in order to earn it.\u201d</p><p>She added that the Department of Economic Opportunity recently received a grant from the state for job training and education, which could help workers who may want to move into a different field.\u00a0</p><p>At the legislative level, former Assemblywoman Luz Rivas attempted to pass Assembly Bill (AB) 3043, \u201cThe Silicosis Prevention Act,\u201d to protect stone fabrication workers. Although the effort fell short before she was elected to Congress, State Sen. Caroline Menjivar has picked up the torch and introduced Senate Bill (SB) 20, the Silicosis Training, Outreach and Prevention (STOP) Act.</p><p>The bill, which passed in the State Senate on Tuesday (67-0), would adopt a training program for best practices in stone fabrication; develop a certification process; and create and maintain a public database and tracking system for compliant fabrication shops.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOur momentum to STOP silicosis from becoming a full-fledged epidemic in California surges with SB 20 clearing the House of Origin hurdle, and being sent to my colleagues in the Assembly,\u201d Menjivar said in a statement. \u201cEven after Cal/OSHA adopted new permanent rules, cases continue to be on the rise. In fact, since I introduced the bill, over 80 new cases have been identified. That is why SB 20 is still very much needed to fill in the oversight gaps that allow shops to slip through the cracks and exploit vulnerable workers.\u201d</p><p>Although every attempt to prevent workers from contracting silicosis is applauded by advocates and healthcare professionals, many believe these legislative efforts put the onus on small fabrication shops rather than targeting the root of the problem \u2013 engineered stone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think that any amount of awareness helps, especially to the extent that then consumers might become aware of this epidemic,\u201d said James Nevin, an attorney spearheading the artificial stone litigation at Brayton Purcell LLP.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut a lot more needs to be done,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat they really should be considering is a ban on artificial stone.\u201d</p><p>Because of its durability, stain resistance and customizability, over the past decade engineered stone has taken over the market, becoming the most popular countertop material in the nation in 2021. The epidemic of silicosis plaguing stone fabricators only arose after it was introduced.</p><p>While manufacturers claim the material can be safely worked with, many studies are concluding that even updated protections will not prevent workers from contracting silicosis.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSilica and other components of artificial stone dust, even when all [Cal/OSHA recommended] methods are used, are far above the PEL [Permissible Exposure Limit],\u201d said Nevin. \u201cTo pretend that if we just license and train shops, somehow we won\u2019t have this problem, is simply ignoring the science.\u201d</p><p>Artificial stone contains substantially more crystalline silicathan other materials \u2013 over 90% as compared to around 50% in granite and 2% in natural stone. Further, the silica is pulverized and compressed in production, meaning that when cut, the dust particles are much smaller and easier to inhale than when fabricating natural stone.</p><p>While there has been pushback to banning the product in California, last year Australia became the first country to ban the sale and use of engineered stone in new construction.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this irrational fear among politicians that, if we ban artificial stone, then all these workers and companies are going to go out of business,\u201d said Nevin. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t reflect the factual reality that they were fabricating before artificial stone was invented, and they\u2019ll be fabricating after. \u2026 Australia has banned artificial stone, and the fabrication companies are still in business.\u201d</p><p>Horvath said officials are looking into information and research regarding restricting the allowable silica percentage in engineered stone as a potential solution. Due to expensive lawsuits and Australia\u2019s ban, many manufacturers are beginning to offer new \u201clow silica\u201d engineered stone. This may seem like an alternative, but the potential health risks of these new products may not be known for another decade.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhile I appreciate that people want to have beautiful things in their homes and in their businesses,\u201d said Horvath, \u201cwe also need to protect people\u2019s lives and safety, and we shouldn\u2019t be putting people in harm\u2019s way in order to achieve that.\u201d</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://sanfernandosun.com/2025/06/04/la-county-board-of-supervisors-proclaim-june-as-silicosis-awareness-month/\">LA County Board of Supervisors Proclaim June as Silicosis Awareness Month</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://sanfernandosun.com\">The San Fernando Valley Sun</a>.</p>",
