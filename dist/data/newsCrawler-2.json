    "body": "Greg Mike: Why is it critical for men to start having more open conversations about their mental health?\nDr. Ryan Breshears: That’s a great question. Men tend to delay seeking help more than women. Frankly, it’s a mortality issue. Men have higher suicide rates than women and tend to have a higher prevalence of substance abuse disorders. Anything we can do to get men talking is important.\nGreg: Got it. Then, what are some early signs of stress-related mental health issues in adults that we should be aware of?\nDr. Breshears: Increased irritability, changes in mood, decreased interest in social engagement, and insomnia—both the inability to fall asleep and waking up mid-sleep—are all important signals that a mental health problem might be emerging.\nGreg: That makes sense. So, how does treating your whole health play a role in supporting mental well-being?\nDr. Breshears: I think the days of talking about physical problems versus mental problems are over. We have a body of research and decades of science that shows the interplay between the physical and the emotional.\nGreg: How is Wellstar addressing that?\nDr. Breshears: We’re making a concerted effort to remove barriers to access. So, for example, bringing behavioral health into primary care, cardiac care, pediatrics, women’s health …We want to strategically integrate wherever patients are receiving care.\nGreg: Now, what can workplaces do to create a culture where employees feel safe to seek mental health support?\nDr. Breshears: First, I think we have to pay attention to what’s causing stress to our employees and commit to resolving those issues. Secondly, we need to establish clear pathways so people can access support without all the stumbling blocks and delays they often run into.\nGreg: How can we prioritize behavioral health as a key component of overall well-being?\nDr. Breshears: The answer lies in commitment and understanding. It’s the employer’s responsibility to promote a culture in which people can accomplish the aims of the business without compromising the physical, emotional, or spiritual well-being of their employees.\nGreg: As a leader, I’m constantly learning. I’m trying to be more understanding, more compassionate, and a better communicator with my team.\nDr. Breshears: Yes. It starts with understanding an individual’s needs. What works for me is not necessarily going to work for you, but there are some common denominators. We’re social creatures, so having environments where people come in and feel good about their day-to-day interactions is important.\nGreg: People spend so much of their lives working, you want it to be something that they’re inspired by and that they enjoy.\nDr. Breshears: So, how do you handle that work/life balance that everyone strives for?\nGreg: I wish I could say that I was better at it. I’m very obsessive-compulsive and I’m always on; I don’t have an off switch. I’m trying to learn to set boundaries because I realize that it is important, and you can get burnout.\nDr. Breshears: How does that manifest for you?\nGreg: It’s a lot about physical health, like you said. I’ll start getting sick and worn down and feeling lethargic and depressed. It means I’ve got to stop or slow down.\nDr. Breshears: So, how do you keep your energy levels up?\nGreg: I try to stay physical. If I’m out on a golf course in nature doing something active, that helps. Running is huge. I feel like the goalpost is constantly moving and that’s something I struggle with. I’m trying to take the time to appreciate my accomplishments.\nDr. Breshears: When you were younger, what kind of thoughts were you battling?\nGreg: I come from a divorced family, which was a big trigger. Art has always been therapy for me. It’s something that listens to me when no one else is around. In the beginning, a lot of what I drew was very dark; there were things in my head that I needed to get out.\nDr. Breshears: And how did your style change from dark to a positive light?\nGreg: When I started painting murals around the world, my heart started to shift. I felt like I should paint something positive. The more I put color and brightness and positivity out there, the more I saw people react, which made me feel better. It was kind of like a positive snowball effect for me.\nDr. Breshears: Out of all your work, what piece best conveys your advocacy for behavioral health awareness?\nGreg: Honestly, my Larry Loudmouf character. I was drawing this giant mouth all over and I had an idea: What if I put it on social media and see what’s on everyone else’s mind? It’s turned into this “Loudmouf says” project; the character is now the voice of something larger than me.\nDr. Breshears: Is there a correlation between how you’re feeling and what shows up in your art?\nGreg: Color is very powerful when it comes to murals. It brings people a lot of happiness and positivity when you’re driving down a city street that’s all gray buildings and you turn a corner and get blasted with color. Just create what’s in your head and bring it to life.\nVisit wellstar.org/mentalhealth\n",

    "body": "Photograph courtesy of Nicholas Church\nMany people dread a trip to the doctor’s office thanks to long wait times, inefficiencies, and Byzantine billing processes. Concierge medicine, a newer style of healthcare, is on the rise, with many Atlanta practices switching to the model to benefit the patient-doctor relationship.\nCraig Peters, MD, a concierge internist withPiedmont Internal Medicine, made the switch in April to the concierge model. One doctor in his practice had already switched, which encouraged the remaining doctors to do so. “The model is transformative, enabling unrushed visits with time to address not just urgent issues, but focus on preventative health and longevity,” he says, which is not possible in a traditional model.\nDr. Peters says that, according to recent research, the average wait time in Atlanta to see a physician in a traditional practice is 45 days, and in-office wait times can be 20 to 30 minutes for a 15-minute appointment. Piedmont Internal Medicine has people who answer the phone immediately and appointments are available the same or next day. “Our appointments are leisurely, 30 minutes on average for routine matters, and 60 minutes for the annual comprehensive assessment.”\nNicholas Church, MD, opened his concierge practice,Somerset Medical, this year. Originally from Somerset, England, he began his career in American healthcare at Emory Healthcare in 2007 as a general internist. “I saw the doctor-patient relationship get squeezed and compromised. There was so much red tape; I’d get up at 5 a.m. and spend three hours on paperwork before even seeing a patient,” he said.\nHis practice also gives access to wellness offerings such as IV therapy and advanced cancer screenings in addition to regular membership services. He’s even been able to meet a patient in the emergency room and guide them through the admissions process, and check up on them. “The real advantage is access,” he says. “This is a personal relationship. In my last role, I had 5,000 patients. Concierge doctors typically have about 200 patients.”\nConcierge models can be cost-prohibitive, with average practice membership ranging from $2,000 to $5,000, and in some parts of the country, up to $10,000. While expensive, it helps the practices keep their patient pool smaller, allowing the doctors to devote more time.\nThere are also ethical implications to the trend. According to Dorothy Leone-Glasser, the executive director of the nonprofitAdvocates for Responsible Care(ARxC), this creates even more disparity and lack of equity. “We already have a shortage of physicians in Georgia, especially primary care physicians, and choosing patients based on the ability to pay limits access,” she says. “Physicians take an oath and have a moral obligation to serve all patients, so this raises concerns about neglecting their duty of care.” She says one way that concierge practices can counter this impact is by giving back to underserved communities.\n",

    "body": "Photograph by Bonnie Heath\nMandy Smith, a certified family nurse practitioner, has had their share of difficulties as a queer person working in healthcare. Although Smith, who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, has never experienced any overt hostility, they felt for a long time that being fully true to themselves might compromise their sense of safety at work. Throughout nursing school and later, working in various hospitals, Smith always felt the need to “perform” in front of patients and colleagues.\n“That’s been a really interesting part of starting [All Y’all],” Smith says. “Providing affirming care to other people . . . It’s been so affirming for me. I get to show up at work every day as exactly who I am, not holding anything back.”\nAll Y’all, which opened last September, is one of Atlanta’s first queer-run primary care providers that specializes in gender-affirming care such as gender transition support. While the practice is open to all adult patients, Smith is most passionate about ensuring that transgender individuals have a safe space to receive healthcare.\nThis is more important than ever in the wake of new anti-trans legislation across the country. Twenty-seven states have now passed laws restricting gender-affirming care for transgender youth, and research by the Human Rights Campaign found thatmore than half of transgender adults have considered moving states in response to gender-affirming care restrictions.\nAbout 46 percent of All Y’all patients are transgender or gender expansive, and Smith believes that as a nonbinary person themself, they are uniquely well suited to be those patients’ practitioner. “There’s just something about knowing that the person across from you has walked some of the same road you’ve walked,” Smith says. “I think it helps to foster trust and a sense of safety, and for a lot of patients, it’s the first time they’re really getting to experience that in a healthcare setting.”\nSince All Y’all launched last year, Smith has built a loyal patient base from neighborhood word of mouth and small community events they have organized. Smith hosts a regular series called “TEA on Tuesday,” where people can learn more about testosterone and estrogen administration (hence the “tea”), view demonstrations, and use practice pads to learn how to inject the hormones. In the long run, Smith hopes to establish a scholarship fund that will support queer-identifying people pursuing careers in healthcare, to help foster the next generation of affirming providers.\nWhile All Y’all will continue providing specialized resources for LGBTQ+ individuals, Smith welcomes all kinds of patients. “A lot of people—regardless of who they are, where they come from—have had traumatizing medical experiences,” they say. “That’s truly where the name [All Y’all] came from. I’m really passionate about taking care of my queer community, but I want to take care of everyone. Everyone deserves to be affirmed.”\nThis article appears in ourMay 2025 issue.\n",

    "body": "Photograph courtesy of Stronger Now Gym\nAs we age, muscle mass naturally declines,accelerating after age 50. This can lead to decreased endurance, strength, and flexibility, all of which are important for daily functions like balance, stability, and coordination. That’s something Alex Mitchell, the founder ofStronger Now Gymin Sandy Springs, wants to change for his clients.\nMitchell started in traditional fitness, working as a personal training manager for brands like Crunch and L.A. Fitness. “All my trainers wanted to work with the same kind of client, someone between 15 and 45 who was generally healthy and had specific goals,” he says. No one wanted to work out with older clients, but Mitchell loved them. “They had great stories, were generally easy to work with, and stayed consistent,” he says.\nPhotograph courtesy of Stronger Now Gym\nThat experience led him to believe that there was a need for a gym just for these clients. He opened in 2020, exclusively catering to an over-50 crowd. Stronger Now Gym offers personal training sessions and group training sessions where clients can get stronger with dedicated support from trained professionals who understand their unique needs, whether it’s to pick up a heavy grandchild in a supported way or meet a swimming goal at their local gym.\n“In exercise, you have to walk the line between doing enough to make the change so that you’re better and stronger, but overdoing it can cause injury or acute soreness. That line is thick and easy to walk when you’re in your 20s, and it gets thinner as you age,” he says.\nPhotograph courtesy of Stronger Now Gym\nWhile Mitchell and his team train everyone individually, there’s a common thread. “Our clients come to us because they have noticed their bodies are losing capacity that they’re not willing to go without,” he says. He and his team of certified professional barbell coaches, exercise physiologists, biomedical physiologists, and lifestyle medicine practitioners help them get stronger to retain those abilities under unique supervision where trainers can take into account things like medical history and previous injury.\nOne of the most important parts of Stronger Now Gym is the social aspect. “We know we need to exercise, eat healthy, and be social [to age well],” he says. “The social part of this gym has taken off. Our clients are all in a similar stage of life, so it’s easy for them to make friends, something that’s incredibly important for this population.”\n",

A chance encounter led him to discover how many nutrition fanatics were starting their days with water with a squeeze of lemon for the potential dietary and wellness benefits.\nHe was sold on the product, but not the strategy. “Lemon water became a part of my morning routine, but it sucked,” he says. “You have to buy the lemons, cut them, and squeeze the juice. It’s bland, it’s horrifying. I had a moment where I was like, ‘Can we make this taste good?’”\nToday, his eight-year-old company Lemon Perfect is valued at $200 million and has investors including Beyoncé behind it. They have sold over 120 million bottles of lemon water, which comes in flavors such as peach, lime, and sunshine tea. It has 10 calories and zero sugar, making it an attractive beverage in today’s health-conscious world.\n“Lemon water is a great hydration boost, and it encourages people to drink more water. It’s a great source of vitamin C, which is an antioxidant that supports immune function, skin health, and digestion,” he says. There’s some evidence to back up Hufnagel’s claims: vitamin C has been shown to contribute to ahealthy heartandaid in digestion, and people tend todrink more waterwhen it tastes better, too.\nHufnagel moved his company to Atlanta in 2021, purely as a business decision, when the company first began working with Publix. “Atlanta is wonderful, but it’s more than just being around other beverage brands. It’s a great place forstart-up culture and entrepreneurs. You can’t beat the cost of living, the climate, the culture, the talent, and of course the airport,” he says.\n",

While therapy and medication are two of the most prevalent ways to reduce stress and anxiety, there is one often underutilized method that’s been scientifically proven to reduce stress quickly: tapping, or Emotional Freedom Technique.\nThe technique combines acupressure and psychology to balance the body and reduce stress, often immediately.Melissa Lester, LCSW, is a Sandy Springs-based psychotherapist who uses tapping in her private practice, as well as in her work with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Georgia School Counselors Association, and Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute, among other organizations.\n“Tapping activates the 10 largest energy channels in the body where Western science has proven that energy travels fastest,” she explains. “By tapping, you can quickly process what hasn’t been processed, such as trauma or stress, and bring the nervous system back into a natural state of calm and relaxation, going from activation to deactivation.” According to Lester, tapping can help reduce blood pressure, cortisol, anxiety, and physical pain severity.\nWhile Lester and other professionals incorporate it into their practices, it can be done anytime, anywhere, with the help of free resources like apps and videos online. To do it, sit comfortably and close your eyes. Then, gently tap points across the face and body as guided by an instructional video, such as the eyebrows, under the eyes, and collarbone, while listening to and repeating affirmations. Online tapping resources will guide you where to tap and when, and some sessions can last as few as three minutes.\nLester uses it clinically to help with things such as interrupting cravings for substance abuse patients or intercepting panic attacks, or those suffering from PTSD. But she is adamant that it can be done anywhere by anybody in times of need. “You can do it in a parking lot or bathroom stall at work, anywhere you need to slow down your nervous system,” she says.\n",

The startup was founded by Vedant Pradeep and Ziyi Gao, two Georgia Tech graduates who realized there was no middle ground to help those who didn’t have a clinical problem with alcohol but wanted to change their habits.\n“We were fascinated by the idea of the peak human condition, where someone is the best version of themselves mentally, physically, and emotionally,” Pradeep explains. He acknowledges that was a bit esoteric, so they looked into solving a targeted problem. Pradeep has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and the pair of engineers set about trying to help those with similar conditions. “We began talking to people with OCD and realized that a lot of them were using alcohol as a way to self-medicate,” he says.\nThey switched gears, and now Reframe focuses solely on a user’s relationship with alcohol. The app uses science to help users develop coping strategies. “Alcohol is not the problem itself; it’s a symptom. It’s a bad coping strategy,” he says. “We help users figure out what the real problem is and how to cope in a healthier fashion.”\nPaid users get personalized programs that can help with individual goals, monitoring progress, meditations, dream tracking, and more. Everything is science-based and vetted by medical professionals, including three Emory University doctors on the medical advisory board. There are lessons, exercises, and content that take about 10 minutes a day to do, with the hope of changing behavior patterns over time. There’s also a community aspect, where users can talk directly with each other and lend accountability and support 24/7, and one-on-one coaching for anyone looking for extra help.\nTo date, Reframe has helped over one million people change their relationship with alcohol and has raised over $27 million in funds through three rounds, including $14 million from David Cummings of Atlanta Ventures, who was the app’s first investor.\n“We’ve found that the real way to help someone cut back is to help them not need alcohol in the first place. To do that, you need to help them manage their emotions and build healthier habits,” Pradeep says.\n",

    "body": "Photograph by galitskaya/iStock/Getty Images Plus\nAny Atlantan who suffers from allergies knows that spring and fall can be brutal, and it doesn’t feel good to allergy sufferers to see that the city keeps breaking its own pollen count records. It can be even worse for children, though, who aren’t as good at identifying symptoms and communicating their discomfort.\nAtlanta’s allergy season can feel like it lasts all year, and that’s because it kind of does, depending on what you are allergic to. Dr. Sofia Edwards-Salmon, an allergist withChacko Allergy, says tree pollen kicks off in February and goes until April, then grass pollen hits around May and June. High summer offers slight relief before weed pollen stirs up around September to October. It’s the price we pay for living in the “City in the Forest,” as lush surroundings mean more opportunities for irritation.\nAccording to Dr. Edwards-Salmon, children can develop environmental allergies after age two. The mean age is 10, and it is uncommon for seasonal allergies to appear in infants and toddlers under age two. “There are a lot of theories as to why allergies develop, including things like an increased length of pollen seasons and lifestyle changes, like less vitamin D and less parasite exposure [to help train the immune system],” she says.\nWhile avoidance is the first line of defense, Dr. Edwards-Salmon knows how that can be difficult for children and family life in general. She suggests going outside during specific times. “Mornings tend to have lower pollen counts than the afternoons and evenings,” she says. She also suggests rinsing off and changing clothes after coming inside, as well as wiping down pets who might track in pollen. If an older child is amenable, wearing a mask can be a good idea.\nInterestingly, the management of seasonal allergies hasn’t changed all that much, with antihistamines offering the most effective relief. Some parents might want to reach for Benadryl (diphenhydramine), but Dr. Edwards-Salmon suggests other options for children, as chronic Benadryl use is now associated with more side effects than newer first-generation antihistamines like cetirizine (Zyrtec), fenxofanadine (Allegra) and loratidine (Claritin), all of which come in children’s versions. “My go-to is a nasal spray over an oral medication since they deliver medication directly to the most affected areas. They are more effective if used regularly and correctly,” she says.\nTo do so, have your child look at their feet when spraying into their noses, spray away from the middle of their nose, and have them breathe normally, she says. If symptoms persist and feel chronic, she recommends you book your child an allergy test to get more specific therapy, including allergy shots, which expose the immune system to the allergens in increasing amounts to build up tolerance.\n",

    "body": "Photograph courtesy of Dr. Danielle Drobbin\nChiropractic care has become more prevalent over the last few decades as people seek alternatives to traditional Western medicine, says Dr. Danielle Drobbin, owner and chiropractor atMidtown Family Wellness. There are currently 70,000 chiropractors in the country, according to the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners. “More and more people are becoming discouraged with our current healthcare system. People are looking for alternatives,” she says. That includes chiropractic services for pregnant women and the parents of children looking for relief or help, many of whom are discovering the option on social media sites like TikTok.\nMisalignments, which cause muscle tightening and pain, become more complex when treating these populations, she says. To treat them, chiropractors can receive additional schooling and certifications, including the Webster Technique, a gentle approach focused on pregnant bodies. Specific pregnancy and postpartum conditions such as sciatica, nausea, acid reflux, mastitis, and breastfeeding latching issues could all potentially be helped through chiropractic care as can pediatric issues such as colic, torticollis, reflux, and ear infections. (Dr. Drobbin has sixpeer-reviewed case studiesunder her belt in for these conditions.)\nLike Western medicine, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for specialized chiropractic care. Depending on a patient’s situation and body, it could be only a few sessions before they feel relief or it could be much longer, with proactive preventative care an essential part of the chiropractic process. “Just like you get your teeth cleaned to prevent cavities, it’s important to take care of the bones that house the nerves of your central nervous system to prevent future degeneration of discs and the health of the nerves,” she says.\nHowever, she says that she has better results when pregnant women come to her at the beginning of their motherhood journey. “People come to me as a last resort,” she says. Those that come early in the process have little to no pregnancy symptoms, better births, better postpartum recovery, and few or no issues with their babies, she says.\nFrom her perspective, her services aren’t in competition with traditional medicine but rather a complement, and one people seek out in a healthcare system that has issues. “We believe in a foundation of a strong, healthy spine, immune system, and nervous system,” she says. “Go to a medical doctor if you need to, and or come see us. Options are power.”\nTo find a practitioner specializing in pregnancy and pediatric care, she recommends visitingicpa4kids.org.\n",

    "body": "Photography by Gregory Miller\nWe’re more than a hundred feet under Beckley, West Virginia, when the lights go out. One minute, I’m scanning the roof bolts and support timbers above my head, and then, with athunk, there’s just . . . nothing. Nothing but the faint drip of water down the rock walls. Gerald Lucas asks me to put my hand out. I can’t see it, or him. It’s only 58 degrees—the temperature underground is constant all year—but I shiver a little. Oblivion is disorienting.\n“That’s how dark it is inside a coal mine,” Lucas says. He waits a few seconds, then thumbs the power switch back on.\nLucas is 74, with close-cropped white hair, a neatly trimmed goatee, and a voice that curls around vowels in a way you don’t hear much anymore. That he can do this at all—flip a switch—is something he never takes for granted. Back in 1972, when he first picked up a No. 4 coal shovel and entered the mines like his father before him, roughly half of America’s electricity came from coal. He worked underground for the next 45 years, often twelve hours a day, six days a week. It was one of the world’s most physically brutal, dangerous jobs. He still bears the scar on his neck from a piece of machinery that nearly strangled him. But every day brought a new sense of discovery, and eventually mining got into his blood. “Every time you take the coal out of there,” he says, “you’ve been somewhere no one’s ever been before.”\nThen the world changed, and miners like Lucas had to change with it.\nEnergy companies have increasingly shifted toward natural gas and renewable technologies (solar, wind, and hydroelectric power), while coal production in the United States has plummeted. It now accounts for less than 20 percent of American electricity. While this has been good news for the environment—coal is a major source of carbon emissions—it has also eliminated tens of thousands ofjobs. Communities across the Appalachian coalfields in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia have been forced to adapt, and many of them, like Beckley, are finding new hope in tourism.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhen Lucas dons his blue coveralls and hard hat these days, it’s as a guide for Beckley’s Exhibition Coal Mine, which last year drew roughly 55,000 visitors and made almost $1 million in revenue—a vital boost for a town where more than a quarter of its 16,600 residents live in poverty. But the transition to tourism hasn’t always been seamless or easy. When Lucas retired from his government job as a mine safety inspector six years ago, the average salary for a veteran miner approached six figures. His federal benefits weren’t enough to cover his expenses, so he had to find another job. Now he makes $10 an hour. “If you don’t work in the mining industry,” he says, shaking his head, “you don’t make any money.”\nStill, Lucas takes great pride in teaching people about the history of American mining (in 2023, he even met country star Brad Paisley, who filmed a music video underground). He ushers visitors into small carts, or “mantrips,” steers them into the mine, and shows them artifacts from years past, such as the old canary cages used by miners to detect poisonous gases and the carbide headlamps miners wore in the early 20th century. “Most people that come through here have no clue where their power comes from,” he says. “They have nocluewhat those miners went through just to provide that electricity.”\n● ● ●\nIn this part of the world, it all begins with geology.\nAlmost nothing in southern West Virginia is flat. Even in the larger towns, houses teeter on the hillsides and the roads wind through valleys wreathed in fog. It’s as if God crushed this part of America in his fist, compressing ancient swamps into jagged shale and sandstone ridges. These are among the oldest mountains on earth, and the New River, which carves through them, is the world’s second-oldest major waterway (the first is the Nile). Some of the planet’s richest seams of high-quality, bituminous coal run underneath this imposing terrain.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coal mined from the New River Gorge powered American industry. Without it, there would have been no electricity, no steel for skyscrapers, no fuel for battleships. But that came at a heavy cost to the land itself. A frenzy of mining and logging stripped this region bare starting in 1873, when the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway connected the upper and lower gorge, and coal camps and boomtowns sprang up nearly every half mile along the river.\nLooking out over the New River Gorge today from its soaring single-arch steel bridge (a half-hour northeast of Beckley), it’s hard to imagine the heart of America’s newest national park as anything other than pristine wilderness. The dramatic landscape that once made this region so appealing to extractive industries now makes it a haven for ecologists and outdoor adventure-seekers. The gorge plunges from roughly 900 feet to 1,400 feet at its deepest point, creating dozens of microclimates for diverse plant and animal species. Steep drops on the New River and its neighbor, the Gauley, also form some of the region’s most thrilling Class IV and V rapids for whitewater enthusiasts. For hikers and mountain bikers, there are a hundred-plus miles of trails cross-hatching the dense forests, and dizzying sandstone cliffs are perfect for rock-climbing and bouldering.\nPhoto by Holly Wolff\nRemnants of the park’s industrial history still exist, though, if you know where to look. Visitors can explore the old coal tipple at Nuttallburg, owned by Henry Ford, and the coke ovens in the lower gorge. The boomtown of Thurmond, once only accessible by rail, looks much the same as it did in 1910, when it boasted several hotels, department stores, and banks. (Legend has it that one poker game at Thurmond’s Dunglen Hotel lasted 14 years.)\nAs mining technology advanced in the mid 20th century, the coal companies began to move on. Starting in the late 1960s, several whitewater-rafting outfitters entered the scene. This marked the first notable shift from coal extraction to tourism infusion, and it came with growing pains. Running a viable rafting business required river guides to bus visitors to and from the river, often through fairly small, quiet communities. “There were people who didn’t like the rafting industryat all,” says Visit Southern West Virginia Director Lisa Strader, who has worked in tourism for more than 30 years and recalls some locals posting protest signs in their yards. “It was hit-and-miss there for a while, and to be honest with you, sometimes it still is.”\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhen New River Gorge was designated a national park in 2020, and the number of visitors nearly doubled in one year (from around 300,000 to more than half a million), it could have come with similar pushback. But according to David Bieri, the park’s supervisory ranger, it hasn’t. “All the local communities in the area are the ones that pushed for this to become a national park,” he says. “And we’re seeing a lot of local groups developing trails for hiking, rock climbing, and mountain biking in areas outside the park.”\nFamilies in former coal-mining communities are often the ones driving conservation efforts, too—even volunteering to help pick up trash during government shut-downs—because they’ve seen how important the park is for their long-term survival. National-park enthusiasts, when compared with other visitors, tend to come to the gorge from farther away, stay longer, and pump more money into local businesses. More than 1.5 million people visited New River Gorge last year, almost three times the number of visitors to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and roughly the same number as visited Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. The spike in tourism pumped almost $100 million into West Virginia’s economy.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWest of the national park, several of the state’s civic leaders and entrepreneurs have also found creative ways to work with coal, timber, and gas companies to turn unused acreage into tourism hotspots. One of the largest and most successful projects has been the 1,100-mile Hatfield-McCoy trail system, a multi-loop spiderweb for ATVs, UTVs, and other off-roading vehicles that cuts through nine counties in some of Appalachia’s most rugged wilderness—. It’s the only off-roading trail system of its size east of the Mississippi, and more than 80 percent of the 100,000-plus riders who use the trails come from other states.\nWhen Jeff Lusk, executive director of the Hatfield-McCoy Regional Authority, explains the importance of projects like the trail system, he’s careful not to present these efforts as offering one-to-one replacements for coal jobs. Rather, they create an environment in which new types of small businesses can grow, and those businesses in turn can create jobs in hotels, cabins, restaurants, gas stations, and equipment rentals.\nAll of this allows former coal towns to regain their strength. “A community has to have people, and a job translates into people,” Lusk says. “It translates into somebody filling up a vacant house, mowing the grass. And maybe you get really lucky, and they’re a young couple, and they send a kid to school, and now, really, that’s a win-win, because that lets your little school continue to exist in your community.” The effects ripple outward in all sorts of indirect ways, and that gives Lusk a lot of hope.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\n“This was our past, and it’s going to be a part of our future,” he says of the energy economy. “There’s going to be coal mining going on here for the next 100 years. But we can also dothis, and this can be adifferentthing.”\n● ● ●\nThere are many parts of working underground that Tony Basconi, another former miner who now works as a guide in Beckley, does not miss about his 40 years on the job. He doesn’t miss the toll it took on his body, which resulted in two knee replacements, a blown-out shoulder, and carpal tunnel in his fingers. He doesn’t miss getting up at 3:30 on winter mornings to drive to work for a 12-hour shift. He doesn’t miss all the time he spent away from his wife and three kids.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhat he does miss is the camaraderie. “You worked around guys that you trusted with your life,” he says. “It takes us all to make it go. I gotta watch out for you. You watch out for me.”\nThat same spirit inspired three-time Grammy winner Bill Withers’s 1972 hit song, “Lean on Me,” which came from his memories of growing up in Beckley, where his father mined coal. “My family didn’t have a refrigerator, and the people across the street from us didn’t have a phone,” Withers once told an interviewer. “So we helped each other. They gave us ice, and we let them use our phone.” This summer, Beckley will host its fourth annual Bill Withers Festival, as well as a host of other celebrations.\n“If you understand the coal history of our region as you travel,” Lisa Strader says, “everything else is going to make more sense.” But she and others in her industry are excited for this new era, in which dozens of small businesses are thriving—businesses that aren’t subject to the boom-and-bust cycle of energy extraction.\nTony Basconi has watched tourism change communities like his. “I’ve definitely seen business pick up,” he says, and he expects that trend to continue. At least one new hotel has opened to accommodate more visitors, and the Dish Cafe in downtown Beckley just cut the ribbon on a second location.\nBut despite these positive steps, Basconi never wants the work of miners like him, and generations before him, to be forgotten. He understands that coal can be a divisive issue—“I want clean air and water, too,” he says—but he still believes it’s an important part of American history. When he meets visitors, he wants to give them a tour of the mine. To tell them about a way of life that once powered America. And to answer their questions about a job most can’t imagine. More than anything, he says: “I just want them to respect it.”\n● ● ●\nFrom Coal to CoolAcross the region, former mining lands have become tourism destinations. These outdoor adventures and cultural attractions await visitors to the region.\nThe Kentucky WildlandsYou could drive (and hike, climb, raft, and off-road) for days in the Kentucky Wildlands and never feel you’ve seen it all. Spanning 14,000 heavily wooded square miles in the southeast corner of the state, these lands include former coal-related areas and businesses that have been retooled as sustainable tourism destinations. They are dotted with more than 800 waterfalls, some of which offer visitors a chance to view rare “moonbows,” or lunar rainbows, when the sun goes down. Don traditional mining gear and tour a working mine at Portal 31 near the town of Lynch, as well as the abandoned mining settlement of Blue Heron outside Stearns. If wildlife viewing is your passion, mark your calendar for the spring of 2026, when the Appalachian Wildlife Foundation will open Boone’s Ridge, a 12,000-acre nature preserve on former mine lands now populated by elk, black bear, and more than 250 species of birds.\nVirginia Coal Heritage TrailThis scenic byway meanders through more than 300 miles of southwest Virginia’s former coalfields. To get the most out of it, start by exploring a 13-foot-tall coal seam at the Pocahontas Exhibition Mine in Pocahontas, where guide Michelle Crigger will share stories from her own family’s history in mining. After, head southwest to Dante, a former coal settlement that more than 4,000 people once called home. There, you can visit the Dante Coal Mining & Railroad Museum or stroll along the nearby Clinch River. Finally, venture due west to the town of Appalachia, where many of the original buildings from this former mining hub have been left intact. Hop in a kayak and paddle down the Powell River, or bike along 2.4 miles of the former Louisville & Nashville Railroad bed.\nBridge WalkDon’t try this one if you’re scared of heights: You’ll need to clip into a safety harness to journey across the catwalk under the iconic New River Gorge Bridge, which soars almost 900 feet above the water. Tours last two to three hours.\nEndless Wall TrailIt’s one of the most well-traversed trails in New River Gorge for a reason. This 2.4-mile trek hugs the sandstone cliffs for spectacular 1,000-foot views.\nExhibition Coal Mine & Youth MuseumClimb into a “mantrip,” or personnel carrier, and travel more than 100 feet underground into this decommissioned Beckley coal mine. (All tour guides are former miners.) In the onsite museum, view historical artifacts from mining’s early days (lunch pails, fossils found in the mines), and explore the historic miners’ homes.\nHatfield-McCoy TrailsThis vast, 1,000-mile ATV trail system through former coal and timber lands (located about an hour and a half west of Beckley) will take you off-roading in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness. Make sure to secure a permit at one of the trailheads first.\nNew and Gauley River AdventuresThe New and Gauley Rivers feature some of the most heart-pounding rapids in Southern Appalachia, and this family-owned company runs trips on both that are appropriate for all ages and skill levels. While trips on the New River begin in March and run through the fall, Gauley trips are limited to the fall dam-release schedule.\nTamarack MarketplaceAn essential stop for anyone visiting the region, this sprawling Beckley gallery is the perfect place to shop for gifts while learning about West Virginia’s rich cultural history. It features works from a rotating roster of the state’s finest woodworkers, potters, glassblowers, sculptors, and graphic artists.\nTheatre West VirginiaBeginning in June, visit the Cliffside Amphitheatre in the Grandview section of New River Gorge for outdoor performances ofThe Hatfields and McCoysandHoney in the Rock, two dramas about West Virginia’s history.\nAdventures in the GorgeIf you’ve ever finished a rafting trip and wished you didn’t have to go home, this whitewater outfit has four words for you: You don’t have to. Accommodations range from old-school (campsites and glamping) to upscale (deluxe cabins), with four levels in between. There’s also a zipline, ropes course, and restaurant.\nThis article appears in the Spring 2025 issue ofSouthbound.\n",

Jumpsuits aren’t common for men outside of workwear, and this one, made byWow Wow by Wunmi, brought a tailored approach with African flair. The fabric was dyed in Togo. What could be more appropriate for an ADAMA event? As soon as Wunmi showed us the fabric, my wife and I knew we had to have jumpsuits made.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nNia Umoja-KhalidAs an artist, I like to be the art and wear the art; this vintage dress was perfect for expressing my style. I have over 50 sequin vintage pieces that I have collected over the years. This dress was gifted to me over 10 years ago, when I graduated from college. It came from my mentor, who owns a vintage boutique. She reminded me to shine bright, be bold, and stay in a divine flow like the ocean. Today, I make art that is healing and embodies that connection to nature.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nIssa GrayI wore a custom suit designed by Atlanta’s ownSylvia Mollie. The fabric, a handmade indigo batik, was produced in Ghana and features the Adinkra symbol Bese Saka, which represents unity, power, and abundance. This symbol holds deep meaning for me, as it’s shared by both ADAMA and my company,Ire Aje, as our logos. While the designs differ slightly, the message is the same—and it felt powerful to show up fully aligned with that spirit.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nLisa and Kamau BobbMy “Western-Afriq” look was inspired by Afro-futurism and, of course, [Beyonce’s album] Cowboy Carter. I wanted to incorporate bold color and a contemporary African woven textile and mix it with glitzy country-western staples. My pants were handmade in Ghana from a sustainable clothing line that weaves all of their materials for minimal waste. My husband Kamau’s look was an artistic take on his minimalist “daily uniform” of black jeans, a black T-shirt, and black boots. He went big with a traditional Ghanian fugu, in an infinity wrap fastened by a truly oversized safety pin. One accessory was all he needed to turn his minimalist look into maximum style. —Lisa\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nVikki Millender-MorrowAfter a recent trip to Zanzibar curated by Jamila and Fahamu Pécou, I was inspired to wear attire that represented the regalness of our African ancestors. I paired this blue and white dress, which I previously purchased from the luxury African clothing boutiqueEtal & Co.in Phipps Plaza, with my Valentinos and a head wrap I ordered via Amazon. I wanted to embrace the theme of ADAMA’s Flowers & Seeds Gala, where attendees were encouraged to embrace Afro-opulent attire to make fashion a part of the experience.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nTre HamiltonMy style was inspired by the people of the African continent, and I wanted my look to consist of items from different parts of Africa. As my statement piece, I chose the shúkà to represent the Maasai in eastern Africa. Then I selected a tailored suit that complemented yet contrasted the shúkà’s colors. My sneakers were a Nike release called “Little Accra,” which is an amalgamation of inspiration from different facets within Ghanaian culture. I wore rings and other jewelry from Egypt, Zanzibar, and Kenya.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nIman LemmaThe rich cultural heritage of Ethiopia inspired my outfit. I wanted to wear something traditional from my home country, Ethiopia, but with a modern twist. The linen material is incredibly comfortable, and I loved how the blue and yellow complemented each other so well. I enjoyed accessorizing the dress.\nThis article appears in ourJune 2025 issue.\n",

    "name": "One year out, city organizers are banking on the World Cup to create a new Atlanta legacy",
    "body": "Photograph by Madeline Shapiro\nWith a view of Mercedes-Benz Stadium’s cascading walls out the window, the Atlanta World Cup Host Committee (AWCHC) spoke with Atlanta civic leaders at a news briefing on June 11 to discuss the city’s plans and preparations for the 2026 World Cup, which kicks off in one year. Atlanta will host eight games including a semi-final, expecting to draw about 300,000 fans and create what AWCHC Chief Operating Officer Georgia O’Donoghue likened to “eight Super Bowls in 39 days.”\nAtlanta, of course, is no stranger to hosting major sporting events, as the site of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and a three-time Super Bowl host. In recent years, sports organizers have chosen Mercedes-Benz Stadium as the site for 2024Copa Américagames, the 2025 College Football Playoff Championship, and the upcomingFIFA Club World Cup. William Pate, president and CEO of the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, says that the city’s experience with large sporting events will be the key to ensuring everything runs smoothly next summer.\n“The biggest advantage we have is our people,” Pate says. “Many of the folks who are going to work a World Cup have been working on big events in this city since the 2007 Men’s Final Four. So they know what to do, they’ve seen it all, they have all the contacts, and that is why people like to come here, why they like to host championships here, because they know we’re gonna execute flawlessly.”\nDespite the city’s championship-hosting pedigree, for Charles Hampton, the Atlanta Police Department’s deputy chief of the special events division, the safety logistics regarding the World Cup keep him up at night.\n“We are excited that everyone’s been talking about, ‘Atlanta has done this before,’” Hampton says. “In the security world, that leads to complacency. We are excited about the opportunity to host the world, but we know we have a huge responsibility to make sure visitors and residents remain safe.”\nJust last year in Miami, security struggled to route large crowds in intense heat before the Copa Américafinal, providing a warning for future soccer tournaments in the U.S. For his World Cup preparations, Hampton even traveled to England and Germany to get a sense of international fans’ soccer passion, observing fan marches and fervor at games.\nBoth MARTA and Mercedes-Benz Stadium will undergo changes before the tournament kicks off next year. To reduce confusion, the Georgia World Congress Center/CNN Center station is receiving a new, straight-to-the-pointname: the Sports, Entertainment, and Convention District Station. For the World Cup, Rhonda Allen, MARTA’s chief customer experiences officer, says that international transportation icons will be added in rail stations to help with language barriers and newfare gateswith updated payment systems will be installed to reduce congestion when purchasing tickets. Mercedes-Benz Stadium is also receiving a small makeover, per FIFA guidelines. The Mercedes-Benz logos on the stadium’s walls and roof will be covered up (only FIFA sponsors are allowed to advertise during the World Cup, which means corporate-branded stadiums like Mercedes-Benz Stadium have to hide their branding), and a hybrid grass field will be installed in place of the current turf.\nWith luxury and packageticketdeals expected to cost thousands of dollars, not all fans wishing to see a World Cup game in Atlanta will be able to do so. Event organizers are looking at other ways to bring games to the people of the city and visiting fans. Centennial Olympic Park will host a nearby FIFA fan festival, and the Georgia World Conference Center will oversee interactive games, live entertainment, and food for 20 days of games.\n“We are excited to bring Atlanta’s Southern charm and resilience to a dynamic fan experience,” says TJ Rogers, Georgia World Congress Center Authority national sales manager. “Unforgettable is our goal.”\nFor Metro Atlanta Chamber President and CEO Katie Kirkpatrick, hosting World Cup matches is “an opportunity to tell the business story about metro Atlanta.” There are two to three days between each game, giving traveling fans time to explore the city’s tourist attractions and local businesses. And after years of planning, city leaders hope that the tournament, like the 1996 Olympics, will be legacy-defining for Atlanta.\n“2026 will be 30 years the day that we hosted the Olympics,” Kirkpatrick says. “We’ve seen growth for 30 years. We’re only gonna go upward in the next 30.”\n",

    "name": "Fifty years after the fall of Saigon, a thriving Vietnamese community calls Atlanta home",
    "body": "Photograph by Audra Melton\nAbout 30 pairs of shoesare perched on a rack outside the door atChùa Quang Minh, Georgia’s oldest Vietnamese Buddhist temple, taken off as a gesture of respect. Devotees sit on floor cushions inside the hall for an evening meditation session. Carved golden dragons with pearls in their mouths wind around red wooden pillars at the front of the room, and offerings of fruit and flowers adorn each altar. The hall is quiet while the session is underway, but visually vibrant.\nThe meditation leader breaks the silence.\n“Visualize any pain deep in your heart as smoke,” he says. “Then take a deep breath—and release. Take a deep breath—and release. Take a deep breath—and release.”\nPeople have gathered at Chùa Quang Minh to pray, learn, and socialize since the temple opened just south of Grant Park in 1983. The congregation is more diverse today than ever before, but it has always included survivors of the war in Vietnam and their children. As they meditate, some of them are visualizing the release of the pain from that time that lingers deep in their hearts.\nLam Ngo is the president of the temple’s board. He thinks the teachings from tonight’s meditation are relevant to everyone, and that forgiveness is valuable because it brings peace to the person who forgives. At the same time, releasing the pain of the past can be particularly difficult for some who suffered the trauma of the Vietnam War.\n“Some people have lost their whole family, all their dear ones, their home, their brothers and siblings,” Ngo says. “Or imagine you spend your youth in a reeducation camp, and you work like a slave. People are not going to forget that easily.”\nThis spring marks 50 years since the fall of Saigon—an event many refugees call “the day we lost the country.” A turbulent postwar era followed, with South Vietnamese people suffering imprisonment and persecution by the Communist regime. At that time, there was hardly a Vietnamese presence in Georgia. But in the decades since, metro Atlanta’s Vietnamese population has grown immensely and now ranks as the ninth-largest Viet community in the United States.\n“We cannot change the past,” Ngo says. “But we can change the present and the future, if we understand the history.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nNorth Vietnam took control of Saigonon April 30, 1975, resulting in the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. It marked the end of a 20-year civil war that pitted Communist North Vietnam and its allies against the U.S.-backed government in South Vietnam.\nThe United States, which had been embroiled in the conflict on the ground since 1965, executed a chaotic evacuation of its soldiers from Saigon, along with thousands of South Vietnamese civilians and orphans, and third-country nationals. Additional evacuation efforts were led by the South Vietnamese.\nThe first Vietnamese evacuees to resettle in Atlanta arrived here just a few weeks later. By the autumn of 1975, there were about 400 Vietnamese refugees in the Atlanta area, and within two years, that number almost doubled. Local nonprofit organizations such asVilla Internationaland Catholic Social Services of Atlanta (nowCatholic Charities Atlanta) helped them resettle.\nIn the late 1970s and especially the 1980s, the U.S. Vietnamese population increased dramatically as refugees known as “boat people” desperately fled South Vietnam—often by whatever means possible. The journey at sea was risky, with pirates, storms, and small leaky boats, and hundreds of thousands of boat people did not survive. But those who made it to refugee camps in other regions of Southeast Asia, and then ultimately to the U.S., formed new Vietnamese enclaves in Atlanta and other cities.\nSeveral social agencies’ offices were in the Buford Highway area at that time. Plus, that area was accessible by public transit and had many low-cost housing options. The thoroughfare quickly became an anchor for Vietnamese refugees and other immigrant communities.\nTheCenter for Pan Asian Community Serviceshas served the Buford Highway area since 1980. John Nguyen, who now teaches classes at the center, was only a child when his parents put him on a boat with some other relatives, not knowing if they would ever see him again. They hoped he would find a safer, better life in the West.\nAfter more than a year in refugee camps in Malaysia and the Philippines, Nguyen arrived in Atlanta when he was 13. The International Rescue Committee helped Nguyen find his brother, who had arrived in Atlanta on his own a while earlier. As teenagers with no other relatives in town, they lived in their own apartment together near Buford Highway.\n“I wanted to go to school, but I couldn’t because of the language barrier,” Nguyen says. “So I just found odd jobs here and there and, at the same time, studied for the GED.”\nDuring Nguyen’s early days in Atlanta, there weren’t many ways to reconnect with Vietnamese culture. There was only one restaurant that served Vietnamese food, and he says it wasn’t an authentic taste of home. But as more and more refugees settled into life in Atlanta and sponsored their family members to immigrate in the 1990s, Vietnamese supermarkets, bookstores, video stores, restaurants, and services popped up along Buford Highway.\nTo Nguyen, it felt a little like Saigon.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nIn the early 2000s,Vietnamese immigrants and other Asian American communities started shifting north, from DeKalb County into Gwinnett County. The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority launched bus service to Gwinnett in 2001, improving accessibility. Plus, Gwinnett offered newer, bigger homes, and after a few decades in the U.S., many immigrants had accumulated the wealth to buy them.\nEntrepreneurship was, and still is, one of the most effective ways for immigrants to build capital when they cannot pursue the same kind of work in the U.S. that they did in their home countries.\nBoat People SOS, an international social services organization with a branch office in Norcross, has a small-business support program that helps about 50 to 100 immigrant-owned businesses every year. “[Vietnamese immigrants] normally start their business by saving up money, or they just borrow money from relatives,” says Trinh Pham, who was a refugee herself and is now the organization’s executive director in Atlanta. “But there are so many other assistance opportunities from the government that they don’t know how to access.”\nBoat People SOS helps immigrants access those financial resources for their businesses, and assists with other needs such as licenses and documents, marketing, new technology tools, and education about occupational hazards.\nNail salons, restaurants, boba (tea) shops, and snack shops are some of the most common choices for Vietnamese entrepreneurs, Pham says.\nThe organization’s office is next to a shopping plaza anchored byHong Kong Supermarket, one of the largest and oldest Vietnamese-owned businesses in the Atlanta metro area. The plaza is home to restaurants, jewelers, hair salons, medical offices, gift shops, and more. Most of them are Vietnamese-owned. Vietnamese customers from out of state—Florida, Tennessee, the Carolinas—make day trips on weekends to eat, shop, and get services here.\nTommy Nguyen and his family openedWow Banh Mi & Phoin the Hong Kong Supermarket plaza in 2022, replacing a seafood restaurant they had operated in the same spot. They are set to open a second Wow Banh Mi location this summer in Midtown.\nIn addition to working at the restaurants, Nguyen is a real-estate agent. “I’m a businessman,” he says. “I see anything we can do to make a living, and I do it.”\nThe restaurant gets all kinds of customers. Nguyen thinks non-Vietnamese Americans are drawn to Vietnamese cuisine because healthy eating has become a priority for them, and many Vietnamese dishes, with plenty of vegetables but little oil, are seen as good choices.\nNguyen has seen other Vietnamese entrepreneurs embrace the recent boom in boba tea shops, a Taiwanese export that’s become popular across the West. But he sees boba shops as a trend that could come and go. So his family’s strategy has been to open restaurants, which he thinks will be more sustainable. “If you could only afford one, will you get your food or your drink?” he says.\nAccording to 2021 census data,at least 48,000 self-identified Vietnamese people live in metro Atlanta, and more than half of them reside in Gwinnett County. Pham says this is probably a low estimate.\n“We are never happy with the number on the census, because most of themdon’t respond,” she says. “In reality, some people say we could be double or triple that number.”\nGeorgia’s Vietnamese population has been growing as immigrants relocate here from other states and newcomers still arrive directly from Vietnam. Some have waited their entire lives for a relative in the U.S. to be able to sponsor their immigration by taking temporary financial responsibility for them until they get on their feet.\nOn a Saturday morning in February, five students ranging from 36 to 59 years old are seated in a classroom at the Center for Pan Asian Community Services office, each equipped with a textbook, a notebook, and pens. For brain fuel, a tall plastic jar in the middle of the table is filled with caffeinated, coffee-flavored hard candies called Kopiko—a Southeast Asian classic.\nThe students have their green cards, and their sights are set on citizenship. They spend six hours in this classroom every Saturday to prepare for their naturalization interviews and tests. Attendance is lower today than usual because many of the regular students are busy with Lunar New Year (Tết) festivities.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nJohn Nguyen has led this class for the past nine years. He opens by drilling the students in English with questions they will be asked in their interviews. When he asks one student, “What is your race?” she stumbles over her answer, accidentally making a pun. Nguyen switches to Vietnamese to crack a joke in response, and everyone laughs.\n“I’m dying,” Nguyen says, with his hand on his forehead. “This happens every time. There’s always something funny.” He keeps the energy in the room light to help the students stay engaged with the dry and sometimes difficult material.\nNguyen has come a long way since the days when he and his brother were struggling to survive as teens in a new city and culture. He ultimately earned his GED, attended community college, and completed a bachelor’s degree in visual communications. Since then, he has worked for advertising and marketing agencies.\nIn the early 2000s, he was able to sponsor his mother, father, and remaining siblings to join him in Georgia—the first time he had seen them since he set sail on the refugee boat as a child. Now he leverages his experience and knowledge to help others who are adjusting to life in the U.S., as he and his family had to.\n“When I came over here, I didn’t have these kinds of resources,” Nguyen says. “I felt like there was a need for it. So we started the citizenship program.”\nNguyen says his students have a 98 percent success rate in achieving citizenship after his class. Some pass the test the first time; others have to try a few times. “They say, ‘I’m not gonna quit until I pass,’” he says.\nBut American politics have made their way into his classroom. A federal grant was supplying the monthly $6,700 that the organization requires to run three citizenship classes per week in different languages. That February morning was Nguyen’s last session before an executive order to freeze federal funds was issued by the White House. The class is now paused indefinitely.\n“The students were so sad when I delivered the news,” Nguyen says. He hopes to provide ad hoc support to individual students by phone until funding is restored or another funder fills the gap.\nA lot can happen in 50 years.The Vietnamese community has grown into an important part of Atlanta’s cultural patchwork, and the children of the early waves of refugees and immigrants have grown up. Now young adults, they are the ones who get to define what it means for their generations to be Vietnamese in America.\nJason Do came to the United States with his parents and brother in the early 1990s, when he was five years old, and arrived in Atlanta to join relatives who had previously resettled here.\nGrowing up, Do celebrated major Vietnamese holidays with his family, but he didn’t become seriously interested in the cultural traditions until he joined theVietnamese Student Association at Georgia State University. The association connected him with Georgia’s broader Vietnamese community, including theYoung Vietnamese Association of Georgia, a branch of the Vietnamese American Community of Georgia—a prominent social organization with a legacy going back more than 30 years.\n“The majority of those members, they were born here—maybe in the late ’90s and early 2000s,” Do says. “Their parents had to find jobs and work to provide for the family. They didn’t have time to teach the kids about Vietnamese culture and traditions. So that’s where the association comes in, to try to help.”\nAs someone who was born in Vietnam and immigrated in early childhood, Do belongs to what scholars call the “1.5 generation,” which he himself calls the “middle generation.” With the association, Do has taught young adults about Vietnamese traditions, while in his career as an insurance agent and mortgage loan officer, he supports older Vietnamese clients in the home-buying process by working with them in their preferred language.\n“We’re able to help the younger generation to know about Vietnamese culture and also help the older generation in the sense of assimilating to American culture,” he says.\nDo and his wife have two children: a son who is two and a daughter who is five. “I make them speak Vietnamese at home,” Do says, “especially to my parents, because my parents don’t know much English. They know a little bit to get by, but their preferred communication will still be Vietnamese.”\nSoon, he might enroll his daughter in a Vietnamese language class. He hopes his children will want to fully participate in Vietnamese traditions as they grow up.\n“Of course not forcing them, just introducing them to it—if they like it, then they can continue,” he says. “They live in America, but I still want them to remember their heritage and where their family came from.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nCulture-sharing is an everyday normfor Generation Z, the most diverse generation in U.S. history, born roughly between 1997 and 2012. Now on the cusp of adulthood, or already navigating the early years of it, some Vietnamese American Gen Zers are enthusiastically sharing the traditions they learned in their upbringing with the rest of the world.\nWith a backdrop of the setting sun, clanging cymbals and pounding drums resonate through the neighborhood around Chùa Quang Minh on a Sunday evening to close out the Lunar New Year week. Invigorated by the instruments, pairs of athletic dancers on the Hong Hing Lion Dance Team bring to life three lions: gold, red, and pink. A man in a smiling Buddha costume leads the lions around the temple grounds as they bow in reverence to each statue and altar, delighting the audience along the way with acrobatic moves and bits of comedy.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nLion dance originated in China, but it’s important in Vietnamese tradition too. Lion dancers often perform at weddings, festivals, grand openings, and other big events. During the Lunar New Year season, Hong Hing’s schedule is packed with back-to-back performances at temples, churches, and Asian-owned businesses around the Atlanta area, as well as at one of the two major Tết festivals.\n“I think it’s very important to understand where you come from; what your roots are,” says Kenn Ho, one of Hong Hing’s team leaders. “When I’m performing, I feel like I’m doing my best to keep the culture and the art and sport of lion dance alive.”\nHo cofounded Hong Hing in 2023 with three friends. One of them is Brian Nguyen, who says lion dance has been key for him to connect with Georgia’s Vietnamese community.\n“I’m grateful that my parents were able to give me the opportunity to do this,” Nguyen says. Then he adds, laughing a little, “If they see this—I’m sorry that I got bad grades because I did lion dancing too much.”\nHo and Nguyen have engaged with their Vietnamese heritage through lion dance, but the group is not exclusive to Vietnamese American members. The dancers, all in their teens and 20s, represent a range of ethnic and racial identities, as do the audiences that seek out their performances.\n“We’re looking to branch out and hopefully get [more] non-Asian people to join,” Ho says. “I think that would be a good way to have diversity within our team.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nVietnamese student associationsat Atlanta-area institutions are a popular way for young Vietnamese Americans to grow their understanding of Vietnamese culture and share it with others.\nVincent Huynh, a pre-dentistry student at Emory University who is from Lilburn, is copresident of theEmory Vietnamese Student Associationthis year. His father was one of the founding members of the Emory chapter in the early 1990s. “It’s kind of big shoes to fill,” Huynh says. “But we always want to do bigger and better.”\nWhen his father and a few other students were getting the club up and running, it was “just pizza parties,” Huynh says. Thirty years later, it’s a thriving, dynamic group that hosts at least two events per month, where students from all cultural backgrounds enjoy Vietnamese snacks, drinks, games, and holiday activities.\nThe club’s biggest event is Emory by Night, a springtime gala open to the entire Emory community and beyond. Inspired byParis by Night, a variety show ubiquitous in Vietnamese American homes in the ’80s and ’90s, the gala features music, dance, and sketch performances.\n“My parents used to always watchParis by Night,” says Jena Vo, an Emory accounting student from Marietta on the organization’s executive board. “It’s very nostalgic.”\nTo illustrate the diversity of culture within Vietnam, each year the Emory association chooses a different region as the gala theme. Last year’s theme was “Sounds of the River,” in reference to Miền Tây in the Mekong Delta; in 2023, “City of Lanterns,” highlighted Hội An on the coast. “I think it’s a really cool way to showcase different areas and cities that are not as commonly known,” Vo says.\nThis year’s theme was a poignant and timely ode to the heart of South Vietnam: “A Love Letter to Saigon.”\nSometimes the generations clash, says Angela Tran, a third-year nursing student and the other current copresident of the Emory association. She thinks traditional Vietnamese culture can be patriarchal, and there are certain parts she doesn’t agree with. But she respects what her parents’ generation went through after Saigon fell and how they’ve “rebuilt their lives from scratch here,” she says.\n“We’ll always remember this,” Tran says. “It’s part of who we are.”\nThis article appears in ourMay 2025 issue.\n",

    "name": "Christopher Eubanks searches for the confidence that brought him to new heights at Wimbledon",
    "body": "Photograph by Growl Bros. Grooming by Jenny Lova/Ursula Wiedmann Models\nSometimes, when his game feels off, Christopher Eubanks watches his own highlights on YouTube. Some of the videos he searches for are from the summer of 2023, when his tennis game peaked at the perfect time and place. He usually chooses his match against Stefanos Tsitsipas, the fifth best player in the world.\nOn his screen, playing on Wimbledon’s Centre Court, Eubanks is on fire. His serve clocks in at a blistering 129 mph, and he rushes the net constantly, pouncing on his opponent’s off-balanced returns. Four hours into the match, in the fifth set, instead of hitting a conservative second serve in play, he hits a 121 mph ace on the center line that freezes Tsitsipas still. Eubanks looks at his coaches in the stands, raises his eyebrows, and laughs.\nIn the clip, Eubanks is 47th in the world, but his play at Wimbledon isbeatingthe best. After another long rally, he stretches his six-foot-seven frame to place a backhand drop shot just out of Tsitsipas’s reach. Eubanks now turns to the onlookers, already on their feet, and waves his arms up and down, sending them into a frenzy.\nTo finally win the match, he smashes a forehand past Tsitsipas. Eubanks’s hands are on his head and his mouth wide open as he takes in another drowning standing ovation from the crowd. “Wimbledon was such a blur,” Eubanks says, watching the highlights. “I was hardly thinking about anything, just my opponent. I was so focused that I can’t remember a lot of it.”\nEubanks, who grew up playing on the courts of theSouth Fulton Tennis Center, announced himself at Wimbledon in 2023. His string of upset wins was impressive, but the reckless abandonment he played with, plus the shock on his face after every win, made him a crowd favorite. His run ended in the quarterfinals, the furthest an American man had gone at the tournament since 2017, and his ranking jumped to number 29 in the world, a career high.\nBut since that summer on grass, Eubanks hasn’t been back on tennis’s biggest stages. The old adage “You’re only as good as your last game” rings particularly true for professional tennis: One bad day in the office punishes players’ ranking, which determines everything from the tournaments they play to the sponsorships they get. A bad year can sink their career. In 2024, Eubanks lost in the first or second round of all four Grand Slams, including a first-round exit at Wimbledon. A year and a half later, his ranking sits at 104th in the world, forcing him to play grueling qualifying tournaments at major events to make the main draw.\nAt 28, Eubanks’s window to rediscover his Wimbledon form is narrowing. His story begins and continues in Atlanta, where he trains in search of the confidence that has made him a world-class tennis player, if only for a moment.\n● ● ●\nWhen Georgia Tech head coach Kenny Thorne showed up to a practice at the South Fulton Tennis Center, he saw a unicorn.\nAlready at a lanky six feet, seven inches, a 17-year-old Eubanks hit with Donald Young Jr., a fellow Atlantan and, at the time, an established pro on the tennis circuit. Eubanks stumbled over himself at times trying to reach Young’s returns, but he would find his feet to hit a smooth one-handed backhand. His whip of a forehand sprayed across the court, with only so-so accuracy. Thorne knew that if Eubanks could develop a reliable winning forehand and a powerful serve, he could be one of the best players in the country.\nFor Thorne and most college coaches, Eubanks came out of nowhere. He was a late bloomer, who only popped up on Georgia Tech’s radar when he nearly beat a program commit at the 2013 USTA Southern Championships a few weeks before Thorne’s visit to South Fulton. Thorne offered Eubanks a spot on Georgia Tech’s team days after he saw him hit with Young.\nPhotograph by Getty Images\nUnlike many of his college and pro peers, Eubanks is a product of the tennis centers in Atlanta’s public parks rather than those at country clubs or private tennis academies. His dad, Mark, and his older brother, Mark Jr., picked up tennis as a hobby because southwest Atlanta has so many accessible spots to play.\nEubanks’s first memories of tennis, and life, are atBurdett Tennis Centerin College Park. When he was four years old, his dad gave him a racket and a tennis ball and told him to go beat the wall. He played in his first tennis tournament at the South Fulton Tennis Center when he was eight. Eubanks lost in a close match in the final, which was enough for his dad to see his potential. “My parents were super busy, with my dad working at Delta and my mom at a bank, but our lives became tennis,” Eubanks says. “So I went to school and then played tennis for hours after.”\nAround this time, a golden age of junior tennis was happening in south Atlanta. Young (formerly the number one junior tennis player in the world), Taylor Townsend (currently the third best female doubles player in the world), and Zack Kennedy (who later rivaled Eubanks in college) all grew up in the area. (Several years later, a certain Coco Gauff also developed her game in south Atlanta.)\n“When they were eight years old, Zack and Eubanks would be the only Black players at some tournaments, so our families connected,” says Sam Kennedy, Zack’s dad and coach. “We all started to hit together, and we just latched onto one another, because that’s what it took.”\nMark Eubanks and Kennedy were self-taught in tennis, and the dads worked together to impart good form and a strong mental game to their sons. “Chris’s dad is very disciplined, and his son was the same,” Kennedy says. “Chris was a calm kid, which made him a great learner for tennis, soaking up everything like a sponge.”\nEven with a childhood dedicated to tennis, Eubanks still experienced growing pains. He was a good junior player but felt he was behind the other juniors who had better training. He played closely with Zack and other strong players but lost matches when doubt crept in. By the time Eubanks got to Westlake High School, Zack played ahead of him on the varsity tennis team. Another hurdle was his height. “He got so tall and skinny at 13, 14, that his head couldn’t tell his arms what to do fast enough,” Kennedy says.\nIn the car on the way to school in the fall of his sophomore year, Eubanks remembers his dad telling him it was time to look at tennis as all or nothing. “He decided that I would start going to South Fulton and train with Donald and the Youngs,” Eubanks says. “There was no warning but also no argument. I felt I wasn’t good enough, but the opportunity was undeniable.”\nEubanks idolized Young, whom many expected to quickly become a top pro player. His parents ran the South Fulton Tennis Center, and when Eubanks joined their tutelage in the fall of 2011, Young was preparing to play tournaments on the pro tour as a 22-year-old. Over a few months of daily lessons, Eubanks’s game improved quickly, and in May 2012, Young offered to bring Eubanks on tour with him.\nThey traveled all over the world that summer, with Eubanks as Young’s hitting partner. “Donald was like my big brother during that trip, and he constantly told me that I was good enough, which was something I really needed to hear,” says Eubanks. “Like, this was a guy who looked like me, from the same side of town, who was always telling me I could do it.”\nWhile Eubanks was in Europe, he missed a crucial summer tennis season for recruiting, when college coaches scout and extend offers to talented high schoolers. But when he returned to practice at Westlake for his junior season, he beat Zack for the first time.\n● ● ●\nAfter Eubanks received his offer to Georgia Tech, the decision for his tennis future again was made for him. “My dad told me that I was going to Georgia Tech,” Eubanks says. “Tech made the most sense with it being home, plus I could still practice with Donald. I think I would have made the same decision.”\nThat decision, ultimately, panned out well for Eubanks. After developing a serve and refining his forehand, he became one of the best players in Georgia Tech tennis history. In three years in the program, he became a two-time All-American and earned Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year twice. He excelled in singles, reaching 90 career wins, which ties him fifth all-time at Georgia Tech.\nIn 2017, he entered the main draw at the Atlanta Open and won his first two professional matches. His performance resulted in a wild card entry to the U.S. Open, where he lost in the first round. As he approached his senior year at Georgia Tech, Eubanks had proved to himself that he was ready to turn professional. This time, he made the decision himself, without consulting his family or coaches.\nGoing pro is easier said than done. Although Eubanks had traveled with Young throughout high school, he was now on his own. He spent the first four years of his career fluctuating between 150th and 230th in the world, playing many small events on tour to find his footing and trying to reach Grand Slams by qualifying. By 2021, his major achievements were a tournament win at an ATP Challenger event in Knoxville and a 2020 U.S. Open doubles quarterfinal appearance. “I always thought it was a matter of time before the results came, but they didn’t,” Eubanks says. “I wasn’t thinking about quitting per se, but I began to feel like I was losing time.”\nPhotograph by Growl Bros\nHis breakthrough came in 2022, off the court. Eubanks saw his fellow Atlantan Taylor Townsend commentating for theTennis ChannelforWomen’s Tennis Association(WTA) events that she didn’t play in. Eubanks loved to talk about tennis with other pros and thought commentating might be fun. His agent reached out to the Tennis Channel to see if there was an opportunity for him to play a similar role. His first match as an announcer was at the 2022 edition of the Knoxville ATP Challenger, the same tournament he had won the year before.\nAnnouncing felt natural for Eubanks and brought an unexpected benefit. In the booth, he couldn’t surf highlights. It forced him to watch matches start to finish, and he started to pick up on the attitudes and patterns that led to success. “Everything seemed so glaringly obvious,” Eubanks says. “I could see myself in a lot of the guys who lost close matches, so if I focused on the little things, I could beat them.”\nEubanks put together the pieces of his puzzle in 2023. In March, he reached the quarterfinals of the Miami Open and lost a close match to the world number three, Daniil Medvedev. For the first time in his career, Eubanks cracked the top 100, debuting at 85. But at the start of the summer grass season, Eubanks was upset in the first round of a small tournament called the Surbiton Challenger.\nHe texted a friend, Grand Slam champion Kim Clijsters, that “grass is the stupidest surface to play tennis on.” Eubanks was surprised that Clijsters would admit she also struggled on grass, and she told him to move on the court more, which should help him get his feet underneath him for both his body and mind.\nIt was what he needed to hear. He won his first ATP Tour title on the grass courts in Mallorca, Spain, on a Saturday, and started qualifiers for Wimbledon on Monday. After the tour win, he started to trust his game. “I was like,I can’t win Mallorca and not get to the first round,” Eubanks says. “Then, once I was in the round, I really just wanted to play on grass as much as I could. After each win, I just thought,Who’s next?”\nHis confidence was so high that you’d forget this was his Wimbledon debut. Next was Cameron Norrie, the 12th best player in the world and number one Brit, backed by his home crowd. To open the second-round match, Eubanks hit a pair of aces, then a smashing forehand winner. He played a nerveless match that dispatched Norrie in four sets. In the third round, Eubanks took care of Australian Christopher O’Connell in straight sets. You know what happened to Tsitsipas in the fourth round.\nFor the quarterfinal, Eubanks matched with Medvedev again. Eubanks felt prepared after their Miami matchup and by commentating on a few of his matches earlier that spring. After losing the first set 4–6, Eubanks’s serve became unstoppable, his play at the net impeccable. Eubanks won the second and third sets in a dominating fashion: 6–1 and 6–4. Medvedev had made only six errors up to that point, but Eubanks was still playing him off the court.\nWith the fourth set tied at 6–6, Eubanks’s serve faltered, and Medvedev evened the match. Maybe it was the heat, or maybe it was the eight matches he had played in two weeks; Eubanks looked exhausted and lost the final set 6–1.\n● ● ●\nThis winter, Eubanks hibernated at theByers Tennis Complex, an indoor facility on Georgia Tech’s campus. Other than a year living in Florida, Eubanks has always stayed in Atlanta, recently moving to an apartment on the Beltline to be closer to where he trains. He’s back in the lab, running through very specific match scenarios with his coaches to mentally prepare.\nAfter his Wimbledon run, Eubanks has struggled to replicate the same form. On the court, he earned spots on Team USA rosters for the 2024 Davis Cup and 2024 Paris Olympics, but with middling results. On the tour, Eubanks lost in the first round of many tournaments, including Wimbledon. Off the court, though, Eubanks has appeared more and more in the commentary booth. He now serves as an analyst and on-court reporter with ESPN at Grand Slams, most recently at the U.S. and Australian Opens, after he exited those tournaments.\n“He can articulate tennis better than almost anyone, and you know, it’s important he does it as a Black man,” Sam Kennedy says. Many of the junior players Kennedy coaches at South Fulton look up to Eubanks and tune in to ESPN to watch the hometown hero commentate. “But the coach in me knows that you can’t replicate Wimbledon unless you’re ‘all in’ one thing.”\nPhotograph from YouTube/The Tennis Channel\nEubanks is careful to balance commitments while recognizing that analyzing tennis unlocked something different at Wimbledon. “I really think commentating has helped me personally,” Eubanks says. “But I’m a tennis player first, and commentating should still just be an opportunity.”\nRecently, there have been signs that Eubanks is ascending again. In November 2024, he won the ATP Challenger in Knoxville, the same tournament that precipitated his success at Wimbledon. Eubanks is confident that his prior up-and-down year made him stronger, and he hopes to get back to where he was as a player, and potentially better than before.\nIn his Beltline apartment, he watches his Wimbledon matches more and more. “It’s cool to see how I served that day and my great shots, but it’s not necessarily to reminisce,” he says. “I want to do everything to get back to that level. I’m trying to remember how I felt.”\nThis article appears in ourApril 2025 issue.\n",

    "name": "Atlanta’s Forgotten Tennis Pioneer: Horace Reid",
    "body": "Photograph by Growl Bros.\nThe kid is clearly exhausted. Facing a fourth match point in the 1972 American Tennis Association (ATA) National Championships final against Arthur Carrington, a man several years his senior, the kid—Atlantan Horace Reid—can’t hide his fatigue. It’s hard to blame him: The physical toll of this four-hour match has been compounded by cramps and a torn rotator cuff.\nReid, a rising tennis star, cuts an eccentric figure: baby-faced with a short bowling ball of an Afro, mismatched socks, a cuff of rubber bands on either wrist, and a neckband stretched halfway down his torso. Barely 17, Reid looks more as if he’s late for homeroom than about to fend off another match point in a fifth-set tiebreaker. He does all he can to slow his heaving chest, to save his thick-rimmed glasses from slipping down the sweat-slicked slope of his nose.\nThe ATA is the country’s oldest African American tennis organization, and this year’s championship is the first to be televised. With a title on the line, Reid needs to win the next two points—which he precisely does. First, he drops a lob over his opponent’s head, and then, for match point, he smashes two forehands that send Carrington scrambling from end to end. “He goes for it!” Bud Collins, the legendary tennis announcer, gasps on TV, working the broadcast alongside Althea Gibson, a pioneering Black tennis champion. The commentators can barely believe what they’re seeing.\nIt was an improbable win—and one hell of a comeback—for Reid. But for those who knew him, the victory might have seemed inevitable: just the latest entry in the storybook rise of a late-to-the-game prodigy who, at 12, became the first Black player to win a Georgia State Junior Open title (in his first-ever USTA tournament, no less); was ranked top 10 in the nation by 14; and so thoroughly dominated his high school competition he felt the need to leave the state entirely.\nIt wasn’t unreasonable to imagine Reid on a rocket ship to the top of the tennis world. Many already saw him as the next great Black champion—a comparison Arthur Ashe seemed to endorse when he offered his support to Reid. But within a few years, Reid’s tennis dreams would be all but dashed: He’d quit college, fail to find consistency on the pro tour, and suffer an agonizing fallout with Ashe, his hero and would-be mentor. The rupture would not only hamstring Reid’s career, in his telling, but also burden him with a secret he felt he could never share: how everything went so wrong.\n● ● ●\nThe whole thing started innocently enough—or maybe not. It was 1964, the summer Horace Reid turned nine, and the kid wanted to steal a tennis ball. There were just so many of them scattered on the other side of a high fence that separated Washington Park’s new tennis center from the neighborhood. But before Reid could begin his career of petty larceny, he heard a loud voice calling to him. “Hey, young man!”\nThe voice belonged to Branch Curington, a tennis pro who ran the center and would emerge as perhaps the most influential figure in Atlanta’s growing Black tennis community. On this day, Curington instructed Reid to help him pick up balls, offering an ice cream cone as a reward. The next day, Reid returned. But instead of ice cream, Curington handed him a racket.\nFor Reid, who was raised by a single mother, Curington represented more than a coach. “He became a father figure to me. My whole personality is based off of him,” says Reid, who sponged the fundamentals of tennis (and life) at Washington Park.\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nThe game came almost effortlessly. When Reid won the 1967 Georgia State Junior Open, held atBitsy Grant Tennis Center, he did so as an unseeded entrant, becoming a citywide sensation. He began competing on the junior circuit and shot up the rankings, as his local celebrity morphed into national acclaim. Tennis’s chattering class anointed him “the next Arthur Ashe.”\nBilly Martin, the current UCLA men’s tennis coach, remembers Reid’s game vividly. “Biggest forehand ever,” he says. “It was just an awesome shot.” Reid had an aggressive style that could “dominate the court,” per Martin, who also served as his doubles partner. (Together they won the 16-and-under National Clay Court Doubles Championship and made it to the finals of the Junior Orange Bowl.)\nIn a city rife with racial tensions, the effect of Reid’s successes could be seen almost overnight. Suddenly, droves of White kids were showing up at Washington Park, hoping to catch whatever magic dust Curington was sprinkling, while others invited Reid to play at old-money country clubs in north Atlanta.\nFor his part, Reid didn’t reflect too deeply on the meaning of being a Black star in a traditionally White sport. Which isn’t to say he had it easy. Racism stalked his travels across the South, while some within the Black community antagonized him too. Tennis was seen not just as a White game, but also as a “sissy” sport, and he was frequently derided as “a tennis bum” and “a faggot.”\nThrough it all, Reid maintained his confidence and independence. “That’s the Branch in me,” he says. His self-determination fueled his quirky fashion choices as well as his departure from Georgia after winning multiple state titles; high school rules prohibited him from playing in national competitions. It also led him to an early exit from the Port Washington Tennis Academy on Long Island, where he went to train under Harry Hopman, the renowned Australian Davis Cup coach, alongside players like John McEnroe and Vitas Gerulaitis. There, he clashed with Hopman, who favored intense conditioning over the technical development Reid still needed.\nThe breaking point came in the summer before his senior year, when Reid, fed up with Hopman, contacted Ashe. He’d met the champ once before, as an 11-year-old, and had idolized him ever since. Now Reid hoped his hero might thumb the scales on his behalf. Ashe drove to Long Island and brought Reid to Manhattan. As they wove through the city streets, Reid explained his situation: his desire for personalized coaching; his need for sponsorship money; and his dream of attending UCLA, Ashe’s alma mater.\nWhen Ashe agreed to help, even offering use of his apartment, Reid could hardly believe it. “My feet are not even touching the ground at that point,” he recalls. “I got my hero mentoring me, sponsoring me . . . I got it made. There’s nothing that’s not going to be available to me.”\nReid remembers thinking,How can I not succeed?\n● ● ●\nThere were early signs that Reid’s relationship with Ashe wasn’t all it had seemed—or all he’d built it up to be in his mind.\nFor starters, before his first tournament under Ashe’s patronage, Reid got stuck holding the bill after his luggage got lost in transit, despite Ashe’s promise to pay. “He said, ‘Don’t worry. Just keep the receipts,’” says Reid. But the reimbursement never came, and Reid was too timid to ask for the cash. There was also a lengthy letter Reid received that concluded with a list of eight reasons Ashe had decided to help. Reid found the list “strange” on its face, “but the thing that stood out was the eighth reason: because I was Black,” he says. “You’re telling me, in this era, me being Black is thelastreason—theleastimportant reason—for you to help me? I found that really weird.”\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nStill, when Reid arrived at UCLA—where Ashe made good on his word to get him in and even paid for part of his scholarship—things were looking up. On the court, Reid played singles and doubles for one of the country’s top teams. Off the court, he hobnobbed with Hollywood royalty, teaching tennis to A-listers like Gene Hackman and eating Thanksgiving dinner with Marlon Brando.So you can imagine Reid’s surprise when, in a phone call before his sophomore year, Ashe suggested he transfer to a Division II school.\nReid wasn’t just blindsided; he felt betrayed. “It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Reid, who suspects Ashe was acting as a proxy for UCLA’s coach, Glenn Bassett, who he believes wanted his roster spot. “This was strictly him doing his buddy a favor, which hurt.” Questioning whether Ashe had his best interests at heart, Reid refused to transfer. “And, boy, he was not expecting me to say that, and things just went totally south.”\nOstensibly, their arrangement remained unchanged, but Reid sensed a newfound coldness from Ashe, who’d always been standoffish. Previously, sponsorship checks would arrive from around the world with regularity—if not with words of encouragement. Now, the mail stopped coming. Reid was forced to borrow money; he says Ashe promised he’d pay him back but never did. “It was so embarrassing,” says Reid. “He would say something and then wouldn’t do it. He was basically sending me a message. Like, ‘Hey, I’m done with you.’ But why wouldn’t he just say that to my face?”\nThe uncertainty took a toll. “I got so depressed that I stopped going to class,” he says. “He made me feel like I was a bad guy.” When J.D. McGhee, one of Reid’s earliest supporters, died in the summer of 1975, Reid flew home for the funeral—and never returned. “I just dropped out of school,” he says. “I didn’t know what I was going to do.”\n● ● ●\nIn hindsight, Reid concedes he should have transferred to another program. “I still had eligibility,” he says. “I could have gone to any top 10 school.” Instead, reeling from his split with Ashe, he ditched the idea of further collegiate development and set out on the pro tour. It proved an uneven effort.\nDespite his natural talent and flashes of brilliance, including a notable doubles run at the 1979 U.S. Open, Reid struggled to find his footing, peaking at 272 in the ATP singles rankings and 227 in doubles. His game could have used more seasoning, but Reid’s years on the circuit were also plagued by unreliable funding, leading to frequent stretches of inactivity.\nThe narrative of Reid’s career shifted from that of a can’t-miss wunderkind to a once-promising player who’d hit his ceiling. For Reid, this was a lonely time, not least because he felt he couldn’t tell his side of the story. “That’s what killed me,” he says. “I had to bite my lip. I couldn’t say anything, because whose word are you going to take? This guy is a tennis god. I’m a nobody.”\nIn 1982, by which time Reid had effectively given up, a reporter from theAtlanta Constitutionconvinced the then 27-year-old to go on record about his break with Ashe. The resulting article painted an unflattering picture of Reid as a player who just wasn’t good enough. Both Ashe and Bassett claimed Reid couldn’t hack it on a UCLA team that featured players like future champion Brian Teacher and Reid’s old pal Billy Martin. (Martin, who appreciates the difficult roster decisions every coach must make, nonetheless takes exception to this suggestion. He says, “He did make it there! He was on the team, and his level was very high.”) Worst of all was a line from Ashe denying he’d ever agreed to mentor Reid. Said Ashe, “I’ve never had what you might call a protege. I’ve never taken someone in.”\nReading that, Reid felt gaslit. “It still burns,” he says. “And it just pisses me off even more that the guy would sit there and bald-faced lie that he never took on that responsibility.Never had a protege?What do you call spending your money on me? What do you call offering me your apartment?”\nWhatever transpired between the two athletes, there’s no question that Reid’s fractured relationship with Ashe paled in comparison to what he felt had been promised—and that disconnect has come to define, in Reid’s mind, the collapse of his athletic career over the many decades since.\n● ● ●\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nToday, Horace Reid works as the tennis director for a community organization in Camilla, about three hours south of Atlanta, where he often feels forgotten. The kids to whom he gives lessons know little about his backstory. It’s true: His name doesn’t ring out across the state as it once did. But according to Richard Howell, who chairs the selection committee for the Georgia Tennis Hall of Fame, nothing should take away from Reid’s legacy.\n“Most young kids don’t even know who Wilt Chamberlain is,” says Howell, whose family helped Reid enter that first USTA tournament in 1967. “Horace has an important place in tennis for what he was able to achieve. He really was a pioneer, and he’s considered one of the legends of Bitsy Grant.”\nIn 1997, Reid was inducted into the Georgia Tennis Hall of Fame. But even that honor couldn’t close the book on his past. There had been a point, in the early ’90s, when Reid, desperate for closure, resolved to confront Ashe. But he never got the chance. “I remember I was in my car driving,” he says, “and on the news comes, ‘Arthur Ashe has died.’” Reid was stunned, and angry. He debated going to the funeral but couldn’t bring himself to do it. “I couldn’t sit there and mourn this guy when I hated him,” he says. “I literally hated him.”\nNow 69, Reid believes there may still be a way to find peace: by taking a kid under his wing, just as Branch Curington did for him. It almost makes too much sense as a final chapter—to become the next Curington, the anti-Ashe—assuming he can locate such a youngster. “I haven’t found [that] one kid that wants to eat, sleep, and drink tennis like I did,” says Reid. “That’s literally all I want to do. Find a kid that wants to be great, and give them all the help that I got.”\nAnd all the help he never did.\nThis article appears in ourApril 2025 issue.\n",

And numbers-wise, he's been magnificent. This past season, he averaged 26.6 points, six rebounds and 4.2 assists over 62 regular-season games played.\nBut even with the trio of Durant, Beal and Booker, Phoenix finished 11th in the Western Conference with a 36-46 record, missing the Play-In Tournament entirely after losing nine of its last 10 games.\nDurant has one year left on his contract at nearly $55 million.\nGiven Phoenix's lack of success, and the hefty price tag, should the team consider trading him?\nWell,according to reports, that's exactly the direction the team is headed in, as Durant's representation has been meeting with the franchise to discuss trade scenarios.\nInitially, the Spurs, featuring stars Victor Wembanyama, All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox and this season's Rookie of the Year, Stephon Castle, emerged as favorites to land KD.\nBesides San Antonio, Durant reportedly has a preference to join Houston or Miami.\nHowever, ESPN's Shams Charania has since reported that the Heat, Rockets and Timberwolves are the three teams with which the Suns have engaged in trade discussions, for now.\nMiami and Houston currently sit tied at the top of the oddsboard at +250. Following Miami's loss of Jimmy Butler to the Warriors in a massive five-team trade, Durant could help fill that gap for the Heat. At the same time, KD would make a significant impact in Houston, which recently clinched the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference for the 2025 NBA playoffs.\nNext on the list is Minnesota, a franchise with back-to-back Western Conference finals appearances that both ended in 4-1 defeats.\n​​Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?Create or log in to your FOX Sports account, and follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily!\n",

    "name": "2025 NBA offseason rumors: Suns eyeing 2nd pick, Stephon Castle for Durant",
    "body": "For 28NBAteams, the offseason has begun, and with that comes drama and buzz about the futures of the best free-agents and potential trade targets.\nWe've got you covered tracking all the rumors from in and around the league:\nKevin Durant has,reportedly, made it clear that the San Antonio Spurs are his priority destination. But, he may not get his way because the Phoenix Suns' asking price of the Spurs is steep. The Suns, reportedly, want the \"second pick (in the 2025 NBA Draft) and/or Stephon Castle.\" The Spurs would prefer to retain both those assets in any trade for Durant.\nThe Kevin Durant destination rumors have been running rampant and the New York Knicks have remained a mainstay in that conversation. They have the assets to acquire the two-time NBA Champion, and he's expressed an interest in landing there. However, the Knicks,reportedly, don't share that desire:\n\"KD wanted the New York Knicks. He wanted to go there. The Knicks have no interest in bringing him in.\"\nThe first major trade of the NBA offseason has been agreed to. TheMagichave acquired Bane from theGrizzliesfor guardsKentavious Caldwell-PopeandCole Anthony, along with four unprotected first-round picks and a first-round pick swap,ESPN reported. The picks Memphis is receiving are the No. 16 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, thePhoenix Suns' 2026 first-round pick in 2026, Orlando's 2028 unprotected first-round pick and Orlando's 2030 first-round pick. The pick swap is a lightly protected first-round pick in 2029, according to ESPN.\nBane, who'll turn 27 later in June, has been a big reason why the Grizzlies have made the playoffs in three of the last four seasons. The 2020 first-round pick has averaged 20.2 points per game in that stretch, including 19.2 points per game this past season. He's also been among the game's top 3-point shooters over that time, making 40.7% of his attempts from deep since the start of the 2021-22 season.\nThe Magic will hope that Bane will provide the necessary scoring and shooting the team needs alongside emerging star wingsPaolo BancheroandFranz Wagner. While both players averaged over 24 points per game in 2024-25, they both shot 32% or lower from 3-point range, which is considered well below average. Orlando's offense wasn't great as a result, ranking 27th in offensive rating (108.9) en route to a 41-41 regular season. The Magic got the No. 7 seed in the East through the play-in tournament, but lost to theBoston Celticsin five games in the first round.\nAs for the Grizzlies, the trade marks the first big shake-up to their core in recent years. Memphis earned the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference in the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons. However, it never made it past the second round of the playoffs in either season. It missed the playoffs in 2023-24 asJa Morantmissed most of the year due to injuries and a suspension. It got the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference this past season, getting swept by theOklahoma City Thunderin the first round of the playoffs. The Grizzlies fired head coach Taylor Jenkins just weeks before the start of the playoffs.\nThe disgruntled Suns star prefers to be traded to the Houston Rockets or theSan Antonio Spurs, according to areport from The Athletic. The Spurs andHouston Rocketshavepreviously beenlinked to Durant, in addition to theMiami Heat,Minnesota TimberwolvesandNew York Knicks.\nThe 11-time All-NBA honoree, who will be 37 at the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, is entering the final season of a four-year, $194.2 million deal. Last season, Durant averaged 26.6 points per game, while shooting 52.7/43.0/83.9. He was limited to 62 games due to calf and ankle injuries.\nIt became clear toward the end of the 2025 NBA regular season thatKevin Durant'stime in Phoenix would come to an end with the close of the regular season. The Suns havereportedlyplaced a loose deadline on when they will move Durant. The Suns are aiming to trade Durant before the NBA Draft on June 25.\nHouston signed Adams to a three-year, $39 million extension,ESPN reported. Adams, who will be 32 at the start of next season, averaged 3.9 points and 5.6 rebounds per game this year in his first healthy season with the Rockets.\nNew York will interview Taylor Jenkins and Mike Brown for its head-coaching vacancy next week,per The Athletic. Both coaches were fired by their respective teams during the regular season; Jenkins was fired by the Grizzlies, and Brown was fired by theSacramento Kings. Across Jenkins' six seasons as the Grizzlies' head coach, the team went a combined 250-214, making the playoffs four times, counting this season. Should he be hired by New York, it would be Jenkins' second NBA head-coaching stint.\nAcross Brown's three seasons as the Kings' head coach, the team went a combined 107-88, winning 46-plus games in each of the first two seasons, with the franchise making the playoffs for the first time in 17 years in Brown's first season on the job (2022-23 season). Should he be hired by New York, it'd be Brown's fifth NBA head-coaching stint.\nNew York's request to interviewDallas Maverickshead coach Jason Kidd about its vacant head-coaching position was rejected,ESPN reported on June 11. The Knicks also were denied permission to speak with Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch and Rockets head coach Ime Udoka,SNY reported. New York fired Tom Thibodeau after losing to theIndiana Pacersin the Eastern Conference Finals.\nWestbrook will decline his $3.4 million player option with theDenver Nuggetsfor the 2025-2026 season,per ESPN. Westbrook is recovering from hand surgery to repair multiple fractures sustained during the season, but in the past those types of injuries have cost him 14 and 12 games in a season, respectively, so the expectation is that he'd be ready to go well before training camp in the fall. The veteran guard averaged 13.3 points and 6.1 assists while shooting nearly 52% on 2-point attempts in 75 games for the Nuggets.\nPermultiple reports, Philadelphia has discussed moving up in the draft from No. 3 to No. 2 with San Antonio. The Spurs already have a full backcourt — which is where the presumed second-overall selection,Rutgers'Dylan Harper, would end up — while the Sixers are looking to add to their own backcourt that already includesTyrese Maxey. Whether the Spurs would actually look for a deal that would net them some additional draft assets to make up for the gap between the second and third picks is unknown, but the two teams have at least discussed the swap.\nThe Heat and Herro seem to be on the same page as the two sides work toward an extension. Herro is entering the penultimate year of his prior deal, in which he's set to be paid $31 million in 2025-26 and $33 million in 2026-27. The extension he and the Heat are eyeing isreportedlya three-year deal, worth $149.7 million ($49.9 million AAV). The potential raise is warranted for Herro, who's coming off a 2024-25 season in which he posted career-bests in points (23.9 per game) and assists (5.5) and earned his first All-Star nod.\nAfter three consecutive playoff-less seasons, Toronto is looking to make changes. On Sunday, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst reportedon \"The Hoop Collective\"that theRaptorswill try to acquire a \"big fish\" this offseason. There are a few big fish that could be available — Durant, who's expressed a desire to leave Phoenix — comes to mind. The Raptors, though, could also try to lure Antetokounmpo, which would be like reeling in a great white shark.\nToronto has accumulated players with the salaries needed to build a package for a move like this — trading for and extendingBrandon Ingram,RJ BarrettandImmanuel Quickley. Realistically, if Antetokounmpo is on the table, nobody should be off limits for Toronto, including young starScottie Barnes. It would make sense for Antetokounmpo, too, because, while he hasn't formally asked to be traded away fromMilwaukee, he's expressed a desire to stay in a much weaker Eastern Conference. According to anESPN report from May, the two-time MVP said he's \"open-minded about exploring whether his best long-term fit is remaining in Milwaukee or playing elsewhere.\"\nWant great stories delivered right to your inbox?Create or log in to your FOX Sports accountand follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily!\n",

    "body": "LeBron Jamesmay be daydreaming about Prime Day deals in his new Amazon commercial, but there’s no fantasy when it comes to his real-life focus: getting his knee healthy in time for training camp.\nTheLos Angeles Lakerssuperstar plans to return for his 23rdNBAseason, which would make him the first player in league history to reach that milestone – James is currently tied with Vince Carter and Robert Parish at 22 seasons. But before he steps back on the court, James is prioritizing rest and recovery after he sustained a knee injury in the final game of the Lakers' playoff run.\nJames, 40, said his left knee is feeling \"good\" after spraining a ligament in April, following the Lakers season-ending loss to theMinnesota Timberwolves. He emphasized that maintaining his body — through disciplined eating and training routines — remains essential to performing at the highest level.\n\"I have a lot of time to take care of my injury, my knee, the rest of my body and make sure I’m as close to 100% as possible when training camp begins in late September,\" James told The Associated Press. He spoke during an interview about starring in a new 60-second commercial called \"What's Next?,\" which announces the July 8-11 Prime Day dates as part of a global \"Greatness is a Deal Away\" campaign.\nThese days, James has built a wide-reaching partnership with Amazon, launching his men's grooming line and hosting the \"Mind the Game\" podcast alongside NBA legend Steve Nash through Wondery.\nIn the commercial, James is asked whether the retirement rumors are true, but his attention drifts toward the deals. While the NBA’s all-time leading scorer might be tempted by discounts, he’s far from done with the game. He still thrives on the daily grind — including practices, film sessions and shootarounds — and hasn’t lost the hunger to compete.\nA major reason he continues to push forward? Family. James credits the unwavering support of his wife, Savannah, and their three kids as a driving force. He’s inspired by the chance to share the court with his oldest son, Bronny, who plays for the Lakers; to watch Bryce begin his college journey at the University of Arizona; and to cheer on Zhuri as she pursues volleyball.\nThe best thing about his children is they've never pressured him to end his career, said James, who has a player option for next season that will pay him more than $56.2 million. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points per game along with 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds and was an All-NBA selection.\n\"They’re like ‘Dad, continue on your dream. This is your dream. Continue on your focus. You’ve been here for us this whole time,'\" he continued. \"When you have that type of support... it makes it a lot easier.\"\nJames knows the end of his legendary career is coming, but he’s just not sure when. He said it would be \"insane\" if he stuck around long enough to play with his son, Bryce, who would be draft eligible in 2026.\n\"At this point of my career, you think about when the end is. That’s human nature,\" he said. \"You think: Is it this year? Or next year? Those thoughts always creep into your mind at this point of the journey. But I have not given it a specific timetable, date. I’m seeing how my body and family reacts, too.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nWant great stories delivered right to your inbox?Create or log in to your FOX Sports account, and follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily!\n",

    "name": "One Win Away! OKC on Verge Of NBA Finals Title; Can The Pacers Respond?",
    "body": "The NBA Finals are here, with West No. 1 seedOklahoma City Thunderon the cusp of beating East No. 4 seedIndiana Pacersand lifting their first-ever Larry O’Brien trophy.\nThe Thunder, now ahead 3-2, just need one more win to clinch their first ever NBA championship, and can do so in Game 6 on Thursday in Indiana.\nHere's what has stood out from Monday's Game 5 and what to expect from Game 6:\nGame 5: Thunder 120, Pacers 109\nWhat stood out for the Thunder:It looked like the same old script. After leading by as much as 18 points, the Pacers, who have shined throughout the postseason with their incredible comeback performances, cut their deficit to just two points with 8:30 left, 95-93. But this time around, the Thunder stood their ground, with Jalen Williams making a 3-pointer and Cason Wallace adding a dunk. The Thunder went on to extend their lead to as much as 16 points, quickly stymying every push Indiana made. OKC forced Indiana to commit eight turnovers in the final 12 minutes while only fumbling the ball once themselves. Williams had the game of his life, finishing with a playoff career-high 40 points in 35 minutes on 14-for-25 shooting from the field, including 3-for-5 from beyond the arc. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 31 points, 10 assists, two steals and four blocked shots. The Thunder are now only one victory away from winning the NBA championship.\nWhat stood out for the Pacers:Tyrese Haliburton, who was reportedly struggling with calf tightness in his right leg, had only four points, shooting a woeful 0-for-6 from the field. Still, the Pacers clawed their way back into the game, with their bench outsourcing the Thunder’s reserves in the third quarter, 20-0. In the fourth quarter, the Pacers outshot the Thunder from the field, 66.7 percent to 42.3 percent, and from beyond the arc, 60 percent to 50 percent, but the Pacers attempted only 15 field goals while the Thunder took 26 shots. Pascal Siakam, who had 14 of his team-high 28 points in the final 12 minutes, didn’t have enough help to lead his team to another miracle win, with the Pacers’ next highest scorer in the fourth quarter, Aaron Nesmith, only adding five points. Meanwhile, five Pacers players finished with at least one turnover in the fourth quarter.\nTyrese Haliburton, who reportedly had discomfort in his right calf, will need to respond after a woeful night. (Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)\nWhat to expect in Game 6:Haliburton’s injury status is going to be the most important storyline heading into Thursday’s contest. The Pacers are going to need him to be healthy to stop the Thunder from winning their first title since 1979. Another key point of focus for Indiana needs to be protecting the ball. They committed 23 turnovers, more than twice as many as the Thunder (11). As for the Thunder, they’re a pretty tough team to stop when both Williams and Gilgeous-Alexander are rolling and they proved that they can withstand the Pacers’ late-game runs. Their biggest focus heading into Game 6 needs to be continuing to play all 48 minutes because, as they’ve learned throughout this series, they can’t afford to relax against Indiana.\nGame 4: Thunder 111, Pacers 104\nWhat stood out for the Thunder:The Thunder went on a 12-1 run in the final three minutes to turn a seven-point fourth quarter deficit into a win, tying the series at 2-2. The Thunder didn’t lead in the second half until Shai Gilgeous-Alexander made a Michael Jordan-esque 15-foot stepback jumper with 2:23 left to give them a 104-103 advantage. After that, the Thunder took control down the stretch while the Pacers went completely dry from the field. Gilgeous-Alexander led the charge, scoring 15 of his game-high 35 points in the fourth quarter, including making all eight of his free-throw attempts in the final 12 minutes. Meanwhile, Bennedict Mathurin, who led the Pacers in Game 3 with a game-high 27 points, missed three costly free throws in the final 24 seconds.\nWhat stood out for the Pacers:The Pacers, who have been known for their late-game heroics this postseason, let the game slip through their fingers, turning what could’ve been a 3-1 advantage into a tied series heading back to Oklahoma City. The Pacers held the Thunder to 3-for-17 shooting (17.6 percent) from beyond the arc while making more than three times (11) of their shots from that distance. But the Pacers allowed the Thunder to storm back into the game – they were outshot 60 percent to 27.8 percent in the fourth quarter and they missed all eight of their 3-point attempts. Only one Pacers player (Pascal Siakam) scored 20 points, while three Thunder players finished with at least that amount, including Gilgeous-Alexander,Jalen Williamsand Alex Caruso.\nTyrese Haliburton and the Pacers couldn't finish out the night with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leading the Thunder to a Game 4 win. (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\nWhat to expect in Game 5:This much is for sure: It’s going to be a dogfight. Game 4 had 11 ties and six lead changes. And now that both teams are on even playing ground, I expect things to get even more intense in this already thrilling series. For the Thunder, they’re going to need to improve their 3-point shooting and focus on being the aggressors from tipoff on Monday. As for the Pacers, they were dealt a dose of their own medicine and now realize they can’t relax against the Thunder, who finished with the best record in the league in the regular season and have the MVP on their roster in Gilgeous-Alexander. Tyrese Haliburton, whose buzzer-beaters and go-ahead shots have been the talk of the postseason, needs to be much more aggressive in Game 5. He had only 18 points, took just 15 shots and was 1-for-7 from beyond the arc. That’s not going to cut it for the Pacers from their star player.\nGame 3: Pacers 116, Thunder 107\nWhat stood out for the Pacers:The Pacers have a lot to celebrate in their first Finals game at home in 25 years considering the following stat: When a championship series is tied at 1-1, the team that wins Game 3 goes on to win the title 80 percent of the time.\nFor Indiana, their bench was the difference-maker, outscoring the Thunder’s reserves, 49-18.Bennedict Mathurin, whom the Pacers selected as the sixth overall pick in the 2022 draft, had a game-high 27 points in 22 minutes off the bench, shooting 9-for-12 from the field, 2-for-3 from beyond the arc and making 7 of his eight free-throw attempts.T.J. McConnellalso had a major impact off the bench, finishing with 10 points and 5 steals in 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, Tyrese Haliburton, who struggled in Game 2 with just 17 points, had a complete performance in Game 3, finishing just one rebound shy of a triple-double with 22 points, nine rebounds and 11 assists. Pascal Siakam added 21 points on 8-for-14 shooting to round out the complete team effort for the Pacers on both ends of the court.\nTyrese Haliburton finished Wednesday night one rebound shy of a triple-double. (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\nWhat stood out for the Thunder:While the Thunder’s defense has deservedly gotten a lot of praise, considering it has led the league in both the regular season and postseason, this game highlighted the Pacers’ swarming effort on that end of the court. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who averaged 36 points in Games 1 and 2, was held to just 24 points on 9-for-20 shooting, including going 1-for-3 from beyond the arc in Game 3. The Pacers forced the Thunder to commit 19 turnovers, on which Indiana scored 21 points. Even though the Thunder outrebounded the Pacers, 42-36, and outshot them from beyond the arc, 45.5 percent to 33.3 percent, the Pacers controlled the physicality, tempo and they simply had more players shine in the first game of the series on their homecourt.\nWhat to expect in Game 4:For the Thunder, they’re going to need to control the pace, limit the amount of Pacers players that get hot and Gilgeous-Alexander is going to need to have an MVP-level performance to prevent them from falling into a 3-1 series hole. For the Pacers, they kept their cool in a game with nine lead changes and 15 ties, with guys who don’t typically have eye-popping stats stepping up in a major way on the biggest of stages. If the Pacers’ bench can continue to roll like this, they’re going to be a very, very tough team to stop, especially on their home floor.\nGame 2: Thunder 123, Pacers 107\nWhat stood out for the Thunder:The Thunder learned their lesson from Game 1 and played all 48 minutes of Game 2 after blowing a 15-point fourth-quarter lead in the Finals opener. The Thunder outscored the Pacers 33-21 in the second quarter to lead by as much as 23 points, entered the fourth quarter with a 19-point lead and kept a sizable advantage through the final buzzer. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had another 30-plus point performance in the championship round, finishing with 34 points, five rebounds, eight assists and four steals. But this time around, he had much more help, with the Thunder’s reserves outscoring the Pacers’ bench, 48-34. The Thunder’s top-rated defense suffocated the Pacers’ offense. Four Thunder players scored at least 18 points, while no one on the Pacers scored more than 17 points.\nWhat stood out for the Pacers:The Pacers were outrebounded, 43-35, and outscored in points in the paint, 42-34. Tyrese Haliburton had just 17 points, including only scoring three points in the first half on 1-for-5 shooting from the field. The Pacers simply looked out of sorts against a Thunder team that was stunned in Game 1 and made sure to come out with their foot on the gas on both ends of the court in Game 2. Every run the Pacers went on was thwarted by the Thunder, who made sure not to allow the come-from-behind team to take a 2-0 series lead on their home court.\nTyrese Haliburton had a game-high five turnovers in Game 2. (Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)\nWhat to expect in Game 3:For the Pacers, here’s to betting Haliburton and Co. come out way more aggressive in Game 3. There’s no way the Pacers’ star player can finish with just two more field goals (seven) than turnovers (five) and the Eastern Conference Finals MVP,Pascal Siakam, can have 15 points on 3-for-11 shooting and this team can expect to have a chance to win. The Pacers need to pound the boards and figure out ways to find their lanes against the Thunder’s swarming defense. As for the Thunder, they need to try to replicate this wall-to-wall effort in Game 3, knowing that no lead is ever safe against the Pacers, especially on their home floor. The Thunder did a great job getting multiple players involved, including reserveAlex Caruso, who shined on both ends of the court with great defense as well as being the team’s second-leading scorer with 20 points, making four 3-pointers.\nGame 1: Pacers 111, Thunder 110\nWhat stood out for the Thunder:Oklahoma City learned a very important lesson in Game 1 of the Finals. No. Lead. Is. Safe. Against. The. Pacers. Ever. The Pacers, who have had multiple historic comebacks this postseason, pulled off the improbable again, storming back from a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit to take their first lead of the game with 0.3 seconds left afterTyrese Haliburtonmade a 21-foot pullup jumper to stun the Thunder and their sold-out crowd at Paycom Center. This was the ultimate wake-up call for the Thunder, who held control for over 47 minutes, behind a 38-point performance fromShai Gilgeous-Alexander, who scored twice as many points as any other player on the court. But Haliburton, who has made a name for himself this postseason with three buzzer-beaters and go-ahead buckets heading into the Finals, made the Thunder his latest victim.\nWhat stood out for the Pacers:While Haliburton's late-game heroics have already become playoff lore, it would be nice if he and his team weren’t in that position. The Pacers had a whopping 25 turnovers while the Thunder only had seven. They also had 16 fewer field goal attempts than the Thunder. For much of the game, the Pacers struggled to generate much offense against the swarming Thunder defense, with no player on Indiana even scoring 20 points. Even though the Thunder only led by as much as 15 points, it seemed as though their lead was twice as large for much of the game -- until the fourth quarter when the comeback kings did what they do best.\nTyrese Haliburton capped off yet another improbable postseason comeback for the Pacers. (Photo by William Purnell/Getty Images)\nWhat to expect in Game 2:For the Thunder, they've obviously realized that they need to play all 48 minutes against this Pacers team, which has made it very clear that theyneverquit. They can't allow the Pacers to go on heaters late in the game, such as when they went on a 12-2 fourth-quarter run to cut their 15-point deficit to just four points. If the Pacers are within striking distance, the opposing team is in trouble. As for the Pacers, while Haliburton is once again the hero of the playoffs, he only scored 14 points. He needs to be much more aggressive offensively for the Pacers to avoid needing to rely on a buzzer-beater. Meanwhile, the Pacers did a great job dominating the boards, where they had a 56-39 advantage. If they can get fewer turnovers and Haliburton gets going early, they could be in a different position in Game 2.\nMelissa Rohlin is anNBAwriter for FOX Sports.

I don't know what that change is, but I know the norm has not worked. The norm worked on the popular vote, but there are states that haven't voted on the Democratic side in 50 years.\n\"We are a party of being [inclusive], everybody is included, right? But I remember Cory Booker, we are at a function, and I ask him why can't the Democrats all agree on something, because the Republicans do that well. You have to look at some of the things they do well. One of the things they do is they fall in line. They don't care. If you listen to some of the things these guys said about Trump and then when you hear them speak now, all they do is praise, they are falling in line. But he said something interesting. He said we have so many groups on our side, we don't just have the White male. We have everybody, and to get everybody to agree on one thing is very difficult, but we're going to have to start doing that if we want change.\"\nRivers said one of the things Democrats need to get away from is the \"Trump won because\" debate. He made an analogy to how he would go about coaching a game if the team was coming off a loss.\nANTONIO BROWN TAKES SWIPE AT MEDIA AS HE FACES ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGE IN FLORIDA\nMilwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers(Stephen Lew-Imagn Images)\n\"I think we need to take the ‘because’ out, and I am serious. Trump won and start there, not ‘because.’ Trump won and what do we have to do differently? You have to take ownership of things. We do it in sports all the time,\" he told Wallace.\n\"Yeah, I come in after a game we lost ‘because.’ But then I say we lost, but we have to do these things differently if we want to win. We can't just say we lost because ‘they just made a lot of shots.’ Then we have to force them to miss more shots, we have to do something different. It is so strange we are blaming the people who voted for Trump for why he won. It makes no sense to me. It’d backwards.\"\nRivers said the bottom line was the Democrats didn’t get enough people to actually go out and vote.\n\"We didn't get enough people out to vote,\" he said. \"That is one thing. We have to figure out, first start with ourselves, how can we ignite ourselves, our side to vote more, because we have more people to vote. We have to make them excited, we have to connect to them. We’re not connecting.\nMilwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers(Benny Sieu-Imagn Images)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"We complain about Black men. You know, the majority of Black men did vote for Kamala, as it turns out. It is just that it wasn't a big majority. It wasn't enough people. Why is that? There is a feel of hopelessness in our community. I think a lot of Black men are saying now it does not matter, either side, we are not being helped, we are still being incarcerated. We still are struggling. So there has got to be an answer.

    "body": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexanderled theOklahoma City Thunderto the best record in the NBA. He won the scoring title. He ran away with the MVP Award. He was named the MVP of the Western Conference Finals.\nBut hisrealtest came Friday, with the Oklahoma City Thunder facing a daunting 3-1 series deficit in the NBA Finals.\nSuperstars are made on the biggest stages. They have a way of willing their teams to win. At 26, Gilgeous-Alexander has an eye-popping resume, but until Friday he hadn't shown that he has a kill switch.\nWith the Thunder trailing theIndiana Pacersby as much as seven points in the final 12 minutes of Game 4 of the Finals, Gilegous-Alexander had the most important quarter of his life. He scored 15 of his 35 points in a five-minute stretch to lead his team to a 111-104 win, tying the series at 2-2 and preventing them from slipping into what would've been a gaping chasm.\nWe've almost become inured to Gilgeous-Alexander's incredible scoring ability. Even though he's averaging 32.7 points against the Pacers in the Finals, that has barely cracked the top three storylines of the series. We've come to expect that from him.\nBut what we haven't seen is how he responds to adversity. You know, the Michael Jordan glare, Kobe Bryant gritting his teeth or the chilling lookLeBron Jameshas in his eyes when he's about to take over.\nEven though Gilgeous-Alexander's star skyrocketed this season, with him racking up the most prestigious individual awards in the sport, he hadn't yet shown that he can put his team on his back when everything is on the line.\nNobody knows that better than Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\"Championship or bust,\" Gilgeous-Alexander told me in anexclusive interviewbefore the playoffs. \"If we don't win, it's a failure.\"\nLast season, Gilgeous-Alexander and the Thunder weren't ready to compete for a championship. They were eliminated by theDallas Mavericksin the second round of the playoffs. This time around, Gilgeous-Alexander vowed things would be different.\nEverything came down to the fourth quarter of Game 4.\nIn a timespan of 12 minutes, the series would be dramatically swung onto one of two opposite trajectories, with a loss all but signalling his team's demise and a win putting both teams on even playing ground, two wins shy of a championship.\nGilgeous-Alexander dug in his heels, and went on to stun a Pacers team that has become known for its incredible come-from-behind wins this postseason. This time, it was the Pacers who were wide-eyed in the final minutes as Gilgeous-Alexander showed he can bethatguy in the tough moments, with the highest of stakes on the line.\nHe used stop-and-go moves to shake off multiple defenders to make a layup. He blockedTyrese Haliburton's3-point attempt. He made a 3-pointer, He made a heavily contested Jordan-esque step-back jumper. He made all eight of his free throws down the stretch, finishing 10-for-10 from the charity stripe.\nHe proved that he's a real leader, that he can stay calm and cool in the face of pressure and that he truly deserves to be in the conversation for becoming a superstar in the NBA.\n\"Same demeanor as always,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"You really wouldn’t know whether he’s up three, down three, up 30, down 30, eating dinner on a Wednesday. He’s pretty much the same guy.\"\nAddedAlex Caruso: \"\"You wouldn’t know if it was a preseason game or it’s Game 4 of the NBA Finals down 2-1 with him. That’s why we have such a good mentality as a group. That’s why we are able to find success in adversity. No matter what’s going on, you look at him, and he’s the same. Underneath that stoic personality is a deep, deep-rooted competitiveness.\"\nLeading up to the Finals, Gilgeous-Alexander hadn’t really been tested.\nThe Thunder swept Memphis in the first round of the playoffs. Their second-round series against Denver went seven games, but in the winner-takes-all finale, they won by 32 points. They then quickly ejected Minnesota in five games in the Conference Finals.\nBut when Gilgeous-Alexander's title-winning hopes were put to the test Friday, he emphatically responded.\n\"I knew what it would have looked like if we lost tonight,\" he said. \"I didn’t want to go out not swinging. I didn’t want to go out not doing everything I could do in my power, in my control, to try to win the game.\"\nSo, Gilgeous-Alexander laid it all on the line.\nAnd in that moment, we saw our first real glimmers of his greatness.\nMelissa Rohlin is anNBAwriter for FOX Sports.

Two, Clark can’t be there for Game 6.\nClark and theIndiana Feverhave a good reason why they won’t be at the Pacers’ last home game of the season on Thursday, when Indiana — which will be either up 3-2 or down 3-2 to theOklahoma City Thunderby then, depending on how Game 5 on Monday night goes — plays host to Game 6 of the NBA Finals.\nThe Fever will be at Golden State that night, playing the expansionValkyries.\n\"I was hoping they'd win it in five,\" Clark said.\nThat can't happen now. But somehow, some way, the Fever will be paying some sort of attention to what’s going on at home on Thursday night. The Pacers and Fever aren’t just neighbors. They’re basically basketball family. They have the same ownership, play their games in the same building, cross paths with each other all the time.\nAnd they rave about one another, with players from one team almost always cheering on the other.\n\"I think young kids, if you watch basketball, you turn on and watch the Pacers,\" Clark said. \"It’s unselfish. They play for each other. They play fast. They play up-tempo. They do things the right way. Whether you’re a starter or whether you’re coming off the bench, you’re giving everything you can to your team. It’s really fun to watch.\"\nMuch has been made of how this is a special time for basketball in basketball-mad Indianapolis, and the Pacers and Fever are both reveling in it.\nThe Pacers played host to the 2024 NBA All-Star Game and went to the Eastern Conference finals last season. The Fever flipped how many people think about theWNBAlast season in Clark’s rookie year, with swarms flocking to their games — home and away — to see the formerIowastar play. There’s the NBA Finals going on now.

So just him being there at my games, him being there, me able to go to his house and just spend a day with him, I feel like that was some stuff that we were missing while he was traveling, while he was in the league,\" Kiyan said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. \"So me being able to spend more time with him off the court and him investing all his time into me on the court, whether it's working out, and him coming to my games, I feel like that's what's bought us closer about our bonding, our connection was always there, but it just kind of got stronger and it kind of grew.\"\nSome father-son bonding came in a collaboration with Meta, where the duo filmed an episode of \"Close Friends Only\" to celebrate Father's Day, where they talked about their relationship, basketball, and regular dad-to-son talking points.\n\"Being able to collab with Meta and Instagram and show our other side off the court, just showing our personality and the bond that me and my dad have, I feel like that was a great outlet to do so.

So just having a lot of opinions and people saying I'm not that good and my dad not being there because he was still in the league, just me trying to handle it by myself,\" Kiyan said. \"But as I started getting better, as I kept working, people started to kind of take my side, so now I got a lot of fans. Obviously, it's a lot of haters out there, a lot of mixed opinions, but, you know, I’m just driving, and I look forward to every game, having a big fan base there. I know everywhere I go, there's going to be a lot of eyes on me. So I just try to present myself in the best way possible every time I step out.\"\n\"My dad was never the type of person to force me on that I had to play basketball, that I had to do what he did. So he kind of just let me rock and kind of let me make my own decisions, but it just so happened that this is what I wanted to do, and this is what I fell in love with,\" he continued. \"So now I have the chance in following his footsteps to go to his school, hopefully win some games. Obviously, the NBA is the main goal, but whether I go to school for one year or two years, it's always going to be there. So just trying to better every day. This is what I want to do.

    "body": "Chris Broussard joins Colin Cowherd to break down the tied NBA Finals series and if the Oklahoma City Thunder can pull away.\nRashad McCants is a former McDonald's All-American who continued his basketball career at theUniversity of North Carolina, where he established himself as one of the Tar Heels' all-time greats, winning a National Championship in 2005 and twice being named an All-American. His collegiate success led to him being selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the 2005 NBA Draft, 14th overall.\nFollowing an NBA career that saw him average 10 points per game between stops in Minnesota and Sacramento, McCants became the first-ever pick in Ice Cube's Big3 league. His team won the league's inaugural championship and McCants was named championship game MVP.\nOn Monday, McCants, whopreviously wrote a bookon the exploitation of student athletes -Plantation Eduction: The Exploitation of the Modern-Day Athlete-Student, joined OutKick exclusively on Monday to talk NBA Finals, Bill Belichick's fit at UNC, playing alongside Kevin Garnett, the NCAA Transfer Portal and more.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nTrilogy Rashad McCants (32) dribbles the ball as Tri State Nate Robinson (11) defends during the game at Toyota Center.(Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports)\nAnthony Farris: With the NBA Finals currently tied at one game a piece between Oklahoma City and Indiana, who do you have coming out as the eventual winner and in how many games?\nRashad McCants:I have Indiana in seven (games) because (head coach) Rick Carlisle's not going to allow certain things to happen where (the Pacers) don't have an opportunity to win, like you saw in Game One. I think OKC's lack of experience will have them put in situations where they'll compromise games and I think that alone will allow Indiana to creep in. And the (Indiana) fanbase can propel a new story to the front of the tabloids instead of OKC doing so by having the MVP (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander).\nFarris: If you're starting a team today, do you do so with SGA or Tyrese Haliburton?\nMcCants:There's preference on what type of team you want to build. But right now, if I'm a winner, and I want a team with chemistry, I'm gonna pick Haliburton because he distributes the ball. He shares the sugar, makes sure everyone gets involved. And he's not afraid to take the last shot. That has nothing to do with Shai, it just has everything to do with the advantages of Haliburton being a team-oriented guy.\nTHUNDER STRIKE BACK AS SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER DOMINATES GAME 2 TO EVEN NBA FINALS AGAINST PACERS\nFarris: You played your first two NBA seasons with Kevin Garnett on the Timberwolves. What was that experience like?\nMcCants:My experience with him was completely different than everyone else's because I got to see the raw element of who he is in downtime when he's not wearing the mask and he's not performing. A lot of people can say through their experiences, \"this is how he is,\" \"this is how he's that.\" But if he hasn't let you through the door to let you see who he is, you'd see that he's just a fun dude. He likes to do everything that everyone else likes to do, but he's very competitive, very intense and very funny. So if you get past a lot of those little areas where he can scare you or intimidate you, you'll find that he's just a funny ass dude that's cool as hell…\nFarris: As hard a worker as everyone says?\nMcCants:Absolutely. He understands the dynamics of details similar to Kobe. I think having Kev as my mentor and vet, felt like I had Kobe Bryant as the same type of guy. I knew they were cut from the same type of cloth, both being my heroes. It was not a drop-off at all when it came to competitiveness, details, footwork, all of those things.\nFarris: You played against Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Arenas, others. Who was the best you played against during your NBA career?\nMcCants:Kobe Bryant was the best. I was a big student of his. But when it comes down to just talent..it's hard to guard a chess master. (He was) like Bobby Fischer. He was just one of those guys you had to prepare two-to-three days ahead for. Outside of him, probably Vince Carter.\nUNC's Rashad McCants reacts after scoring a basket. McCants scored 28 points in a 91-78 vicktory over Kentucky.(Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports)\n…Just that era period. You talk about shooting guards and small forwards, from Paul Pierce to Tracy McGrady to Ray Allen to Dwyane Wade to Michael Redd, we had to see a lot of (star) guys, so it's hard to just pinpoint one or two guys. But then again, it's actually really, really easy because there was one guy that was better than all of those guys - Kobe.\nFarris: Switching over to college athletics, what are your thoughts on the transfer portal? Do you think it's a good thing?\nMcCants: Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, there's just no structure to it. …I think it can be a good thing if it's done right and if kids are not entitled to just show up and do nothing and demand things. There has to be a contractual obligation. For you to get this money, you've gotta show up and go to practice, you've got to be attentive. There are things now: boundaries, restrictions. It's not just that you can make money, and you act like you're a millionaire, you don't have to come and perform. In my book I talk about performance-based requirements and academic-based requirements. If you're here for basketball, you gotta do all these things before you transfer. If you're Caleb Love and you wanna leave North Carolina and go to Arizona, alright, did you fulfill all your requirements?\nFarris: When you were at UNC, was Michael Jordan ever around and were there open communication lines?\nMcCants:He came by. It was Michael Jordan so we didn't have access to him like that (laughing), but he definitely came by to practices to say hello. He'd come back and say hello to everybody and bet us to shoot from halfcourt and keep it movin.\nFarris: Who was winning that?\nMcCants:Me, of course.\nFarris: So you beat Jordan?\nMcCants:Well, I hit (the shot attempt) first.\nTrilogy shooting guard Rashad McCants (32) controls the ball against 3 Headed Monsters during the Big 3 championship game at MGM Grand Garden Arena.(Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFarris: How are you feeling, as a Tar Heel, with A) having Bill Belichick as the school's football coach? And B) with everything that surrounds him right now?McCants:(laughing) I like Belichick a lot. I think the UNC move was a good move for him. But I think with his morale and everything around him now, (his girlfriend Jordon Hudson) and everything, it's just controversy waiting to happen. It's more pressure on him than ever before, because if he doesn't win, it's the distractions that around him and he's not really focused. And if he does win, this is maybe a little bit too easy. You came down to the college ranks to dominate. I love the fact that he's in North Carolina to give some prestige back (to the program). Mack Brown tried. It's an opportunity for him to build something. But Belichick, I just think…he's gonna be a man. He's gonna be a man and do what you wanna do. I'm not gonna tell him not to do it. You know, we all want to do it but you gotta have enough money to do it. And if you don't, you don't. Cool. But salute to Bill. He's having fun. He's living his life.\nFarris: One last question. Ice Cube's Big3 returns this weekend. You won a championship in the league's first season. How big of an adjustment is it going from playing 5-on-5 full court to 3-on-3 half court?\nMcCants:When you talk about preparation for it and the half court and the difference, you play a lot harder because you can get exposed a lot quicker. There's not a lot of help (defense). With 5-on-5 you've got a lot of extra help with two extra guys on the court. You can cut the court (angles) off and kind of rest a little bit. But 3-on3, as soon as a shot goes up, somebody gets the rebound, and you can throw it to (a player at) the three point line and shoot it (immediately). So everyone's constantly running around. You have to be in (good) cardio (shape). It's not what everyone thinks it is. It's definitely harder than 5-on-5.\nFollow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.\n",

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., posted on Tuesday, \"The forever war is the war that Iran has waged against the U.S., Israel, and the civilized world since 1979.\"\nThe examples of Iran’s involvement in attacks on Americans include direct and proxy attacks on U.S. forces, support for terror groups, and assassination efforts.\nIRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY’S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT\nLebanese volunteer rescue workers carry the body of an American Marine in Beirut on Oct. 24, 1983, from the rubble of the American Marines Barracks that was attacked by a terrorist truck bomb on Oct. 23, 1983.

Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran’s first supreme religious leader, took hold of the situation, spurning international appeals to release the hostages. The last U.S. hostages were released 444 days later.\nIn 2023, Sayyed Issa Tabatabai, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s representative in Lebanon, admitted during an interview with the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that the Islamic Republic was involved in two 1983 bombings that killed Americans in Lebanon.\nThe bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 63 victims, including 17 Americans. When two suicide truck bombs exploded at the barracks of multinational forces in Lebanon, 220 Marines, 18 U.S. Navy sailors and three U.S. Army soldiers were killed, and 58 French troops were murdered.\nIn the IRNA interview, Tabatabai said \"I quickly went to Lebanon and provided what was needed in order to [carry out] martyrdom operations in the place where the Americans and Israelis were.\" He also stated that he received a fatwa from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordering him to carry out the attacks, though the IRNA removed the assertion \"shortly after publication,\" according to a report and translation of the interview from the Middle East Media Research Institute.\nThis June 30, 1996 file photo shows the destroyed Khobar Towers and the crater where a truck bomb exploded at a U.S. military complex in Saudi Arabia.(AP Photo/Saleh Rifai)\nOn June 25, 1996,19 U.S. Air Force members were killedwhen a truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers. Al Jazeera reported that in 2006, a U.S. court found the Iranian government responsible for the attack, committed by Saudi members of Hezbollah. The court ordered Iran to pay $254 million to victims of the attack.\nAccording to a 2019 Pentagon report cited by theMilitary Times, Iran bears responsibility for the deaths of 603 U.S. service members in Iraq between 2003 and 2011.

    "body": "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses the Trump administration’s efforts to promote energy independence, countering China’s technological dominance and more on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’\nRecent news about coal company bankruptcies serves as a natural experiment on the clash between various federal and state goals, regulations, litigation, and market realities. It also underscores the importance of having a coherent overarching policy that helps achieve PresidentDonald Trump’senergy agenda.\nIn both of his campaigns, President Trump stated that he would like to see a revival of the U.S. coal industry, which has been decimated over the years. President Trump’s April 2025 executive order (EO) outlines various steps from lifting barriers to coal mining, to classifying the metallurgical coal used in steel production in the \"critical minerals\" category.\nWhile coal has been losing its prominence in electricity generation, both in the U.S. and other developed countries, it still represents one-third of global electricity generation. With the right investments and a drive to make coal more efficient and environmentally friendly, the U.S. can play a prominent role in the future of the global coal industry that includes investment in next-generation technologies to reduce coal’s environmental footprint. In fact,President Trump’s EOunderlines \"clean\" several times and emphasizes \"accelerate development of coal technologies.\" But one integral part of the plan should be to generate enough interest in the private marketplace to fund the necessary investments in the quickly shrinking coal industry.\nCLIMATE LAWFARE IN BLUE-STATE COURTS COULD HURT US ENERGY CONSUMERS, EXPERT SAYS: 'HUGE EFFECT'\nThere was one well-intentioned, but unexpected hurdle that potentially stood in the way of this goal: up until the last few years, the global push for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targeted the fossil fuel industry broadly and the coal industry specifically. The goal of these ESG policies was concerning for thefossil fuel industryas the push to reduce carbon emissions intensified in board rooms and Democrat-led states.\nThese targets aimed to lower investments in the industry through different means, such as introducing stringent reporting requirements. Many opposed these targets, pointing to energy realities and an increasing global energy demand that required healthy investment in the sector.\nSince the 180-degree turn in the political arena last November, ESG has gone mute. Major financial institutions, from banks to asset managers, are largely back to focusing on maximizing returns, causing a mass exodus from ESG organizations like Climate Action 100+, the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI).\nHowever, today we face another threat tomuch-needed investmentsin the energy sector – ironically not from those seeking to eliminate fossil fuels, but those claiming to protect them.\nCiting ESG, Texas led 10 other Republican state attorneys general in an antitrust lawsuit against Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, accusing the major asset managers of pressuring coal companies like Peabody Energy and Arch Resources to reduce coal production, effectively driving up energy costs for consumers.\nIf found at fault, these companies – who have been previously accused of boycotting the fossil fuel industry – would be required to divest their holdings in the companies listed in the lawsuit: Peabody Energy, Core Natural Resources, NACCO Industries, Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Vistra Energy, Hallador Energy, Warrior Met Coal, and Black Hills Corporation. This is a result that many green groups could only dream about a year or so ago.\nBy forcing Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street to fully divest from their holdings, the coal industry would lose nearly $18 billion ($17.9B) in capital – severely undermining President Trump’s goal to revive the American coal industry.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThere are multiple problems with this litigation: experts have been discussing the reasons behind the quick decline of coal since the early 2010s. Abundant and economical natural gas, renewable energy developments, cheap Chinese steel and, of course, federal and state climate regulations are recognized as major culprits for the decline, not asset managers. In addition, these asset managers named in the suit are all purely passive, minority investors in these companies through index funds. It would be hard to connect the decline in the industry to the management of their investments – which collectively only hold between 8.3% - 34.19% of shares in the coal companies according to the lawsuit.\nBut what this lawsuit will do is to strangle the funds that could be used to modernize and grow the industry, ultimately leading to a lower resource base and higher energy prices.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIf the markets are an indication of how investors see this litigation, look no further than the stock market following the announcement of President Trump’s own DOJ and FTC filing in support of the lawsuit. On May 22, the share prices of several major coal companies (Peabody, Hallador, and Core Natural Resources) closed in the red despite the overall market ending the day up (Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500). This could only hasten the demise of the industry, rather than \"reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean coal industry\" as the President has envisioned.\nThe second Trump administration came in with a goal ofsecure and abundant energy. Every policy or administrative action should take into consideration how the process and remedies can clash with each other and become a roadblock in the way of achieving this vision. This litigation is a perfect example of how things can end up with unintended consequences.\nPinar Çebi Wilber is chief economist and executive vice president of the American Council for Capital Formation.\n",

For example, with the 16/8 method, the person fasts for 16 hours and then can eat within an eight-hour span, between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m.\nIntermittent fasting, a pattern of eating based on time limits, is intended to assist with weight loss and other health benefits.(iStock)\nOther versions involve fasting for a full 24 hours once or twice per week — or only consuminglimited calorieson fasting days.\n\"The idea is that intermittent fasting causes the body’s cells to change how they work,\" states Mayo Clinic's website. \"Timed eating may push cells to focus on repair, energy use and balancing body-wide functions.\"\nReligious fasting is practiced in many faiths, including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Jainism, as well as Hinduism, Judaism and Taoism, research shows.\nAround 21% of Americans report that they fast for certain periods of time for religious reasons, according to a 2024 survey from the Pew Research Center.\nReligious fasting is practiced in many faiths, including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Jainism, as well as Hinduism, Judaism and Taoism.(iStock)\nSome view intermittent fasting as a modern-day form of biblical fasting.\nFasting is mentioned in the Bible as a way to becloser to God.\nIn Matthew 6:16-18, for example, Jesus instructs his followers on how to fast.\nGOLFER PHIL MICKELSON’S STRICT WEIGHT LOSS DIET: DOCTOR SHARES WHAT TO KNOW\n\"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. Specifically, when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face. So, that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\"\nWhile religious fasting is for spiritual purposes, intermittent fasting may also have physical and mental benefits, like weight loss and focus.(iStock)\nFasting is also mentioned in Joel 2:12, when the Lord declares, \"Yet even now, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.\"\nVarious religionsteach that fasting improves self-control, increases spiritual awareness and even fosters empathy for the less fortunate, according to Pew.\nWhile religious fasting is for spiritual purposes, intermittent fasting may also have physical and mental benefits that go beyond the primary goal ofweight loss.\nStudies have shown that the practice may have positive impacts on blood pressure, cardiovascular health, cognitive function and other health factors — but the long-term effects aren’t as clear.\nFasting is mentioned in the Bible as a way to be closer to God.\n\"When changes occur with this metabolic switch, it affects the body and brain,\" Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Mark Mattson, who has studied intermittent fasting for 25 years, states on the hospital's website.\nMattson's research has confirmed multiple health benefits associated with fasting, includinggreater longevity, a leaner physique and a sharper mind.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Many things happen during intermittent fasting that can protect organs against chronic diseases liketype 2 diabetes, heart disease, age-related neurodegenerative disorders, even inflammatory bowel disease and many cancers,\" he said.\nHowever, Fox News Digital previously reported on a 2024 study that linked time-restricted eating to a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death.\nStudies have pointed to multiple health benefits associated with fasting, including greater longevity, a leaner body and a sharper mind.(iStock)\n\"Intermittent fasting is not appropriate for people with a history of disordered eating or activeeating disorders, those with hypoglycemia or type 1 diabetes on insulin, children under 18, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and more,\" New Jersey-based registered dietitian Lauren Harris-Pincus told Fox News Digital at the time.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nOhio-based cardiologist Dr. Lou Vadlamani was not involved in the study, but told Fox News Digital that it would be \"a stretch\" to conclusively say that fasting has a direct impact on heart attack risk.\n\"It certainly raises a lot of questions and supports the need for a more comprehensive study, since intermittent fasting has become so common,\" he said.\nFor more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health\nAs with every major lifestyle change, it’s important tocheck with a doctorbefore starting intermittent fasting, experts advise.\nKhloe Quill is alifestyleproduction assistant with Fox News Digital.

She shares her motivation with Fox News Digital.\nHearing loss is one of the most common conditions affectingolder adults, with about one in three Americans between 65 and 74 affected, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nWhile some of this loss is due to the hair cells in the inner ears breaking down with age and not picking up vibrations as well, per WebMD, there are some risk factors that can be controlled with behavior modifications.\nMaking small changes now can help protect yourears and hearinglater in life, experts advise.\nCOMMON AGING SYMPTOM COULD WORSEN LONELINESS IN SENIORS\nBelow are some practical tips you can start implementing today.\nWhether it's a crowded concert, heavy traffic or the constant hum of power tools, repeated exposure to high noise levels is known to cause permanent damage to the delicate structures in the inner ear.\nOne of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to these loud environments, the NIH states.\nMaking small changes now can help protect your ears and hearing later in life, experts advise.(iStock)\nEven small adjustments, such as lowering the volume on your headphones or taking quiet breaks during a noisy event, can make a big difference over time.\nDamage to the inner ear can happen long before it shows up on a hearing test, according to the NIH, which means prevention is key.\nWhen loud situations are unavoidable, and you expect to be exposed for more than a few minutes, experts recommend wearing ear protection, such as foam earplugs or noise-canceling earmuffs.\nOne of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to loud environments.\nFoam earplugs are an affordable, easy-to-carry option; they reduce noise by 15 to 30 decibels, WebMD states.\nEarmuffs, which cover the entire ear, offer similar protection and can be worn with earplugs for added defense.\nSome earplugs are designed to reduce sound evenly across all frequencies, making themideal for musiciansor anyone who wants clear but quieter audio.\nJust like dental cleanings or eye exams, regular hearing checkups are an important part of maintainingoverall health.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults aged 50 through 64 have their hearing screened by an audiologist every five years.\nFoam earplugs are an affordable, easy-to-carry option that reduce noise by 15 to 30 decibels.(iStock)\nHearing exams are particularly important for those who have a family history of hearing loss, notice difficulty hearing conversations, have a high degree of noise exposure, often hear ringing in the ears or have no previous testing history.\nYour healthcare provider will assess how well your hearing is functioning and check for any early signs ofhearing loss.\nWOMEN MAY HEAR BETTER THAN MEN, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS\n\"Screening doesn’t always mean undergoing a full hearing test,\" Lindsay Creed, a Maryland audiologist and associate director of audiology practices at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), told Fox News Digital.\n\"It can start with a few simple questions from your doctor during a routine physical, or even a short questionnaire as a first step.\"\nThe World Health Organization recommends that adults aged 50 through 64 have their hearing screened by an audiologist every five years.(iStock)\nSmoking doesn't just affect your lungs and heart — it can also harm your hearing.\nAccording to a study conducted by the NIH, current smokers are 61% more likely to experience prevalent hearing loss compared to non-smokers.\n'I'M A NEUROLOGIST — HERE'S WHY DEMENTIA IS RISING AND HOW TO REDUCE YOUR RISK’\nThe good news?Quitting makes a difference.\nFormer smokers who quit for longer than five years reduced their risk to nearly as low as individuals who have never smoked, the same study found.\nAlthough hearing loss is common with age, it’s not the only auditory issue.\nAccording to the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), conditions like tinnitus, which often peaks between ages 60 and 69, can also develop. Tinnitus causes persistent sounds such as ringing, hissing, buzzing or whooshing in the ears.\nCurrent smokers are 61% more likely to experience prevalent hearing loss compared to non-smokers.(iStock)\nMost cases are linked to sensorineural hearing loss, the type that typically occurs with age, the American Tinnitus Association notes.\nWhile there’s no cure, various treatments can help reduce the impact of symptoms.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nAnother condition that becomes more common with age is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which causes brief but intense episodes of dizziness, according to Mayo Clinic.\nThis occurs when tiny calcium crystals in the inner ear shift out of place.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAudiologist Lindsay Creed noted that head trauma is usually the cause in younger people, but in those over 50, natural age-related changes in the inner ear are more likely the culprit.\nThe American Tinnitus Association notes that most cases of tinnitus are linked to sensorineural hearing loss, the type that typically occurs with age.(iStock)\nOnce someone experiences BPPV, future episodes become more likely.\nThe condition can often be treated with a simple in-office maneuver performed by a medical professional to reposition the crystals, although Creed advises against attempting it at home without guidance.\nMany drugs are known to cause impaired hearing, including some cancer medications and antibiotics, according to WebMD.\nFor more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health\nIf you take aprescription medication, experts recommend checking with your physician to ensure that it isn't known to impact ear health.\nReem Amro is alifestyleproduction assistant with Fox News Digital.

A 2022 study from the University of Manchester reflected this, finding that moisture can change hair’s response to stress.\nOZEMPIC, OTHER SEMAGLUTIDES LINKED TO HAIR LOSS: HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW\n\"When hair gets wet, it undergoes significant physical changes that can affect its ability to handle stress from brushing,\" Erdogan said in comments shared with Fox News Digital.\n\"The water causes the hair shaft to swell, stretches the cuticle and makes it more susceptible to breakage.\"\n\"Applying the right hair care when wet is the best way to maintain healthy hair long-term and to prevent unnecessary thinning caused by breakage,\" an expert shared.(iStock)\nAlthough research has shown that wet hair stretches more than dry hair before breaking, Erdogan clarified that this doesn’t mean the hair is more flexible and resilient.\n\"The opposite is true – this stretching damages the internal protein structure, leading to weaker hair over time,\" he warned.\n\"Wet hair is more fragile, and rough brushing can cause breakage.\"\n\"The brush pulls on swollen, weakened strands, causing them to stretch beyond their capacity. As they dry, they don't return to their original state and remain damaged at a structural level.\"\nMEN GOING BALD TURN TO 'NEW BOTOX' FOR HAIR LOSS TREATMENT\nAshley DiMatteo, owner of Ashley Lauren Beauty Lounge in Westchester, New York, told Fox News Digital in an interview that the salon has \"definitely seen\" damage from brushing wet hair.\n\"Wet hair is more fragile, and rough brushing can cause breakage,\" she said. \"But it’s rarely just one issue –hair loss or damageoften comes from a combination of factors like stress, hormones, heat styling or chemical treatments.\"\nAshley DiMatteo (left), owner of Ashley Lauren Beauty Lounge in New York, and Briana Delvecchio (right), a hairdresser and color stylist of 14 years.(Jesse Rinka Photography)\nBrianna Delvecchio, a color specialist and hairdresser at DiMatteo’s salon, agreed that brushing wet hair can cause breakage, especially while doing so roughly or with the wrong tool.\nFactors like stress, diet, hormones and overprocessing can also play a role in hair damage, she confirmed.\nThose who have fine and chemically treated hair – whether colored, permed or relaxed – are \"especially susceptible\" to wet brushing damage, since their protein structure is \"already altered,\" Erdogan noted.\nThe risks don't mean people should skip brushing altogether, Delvecchio said, as not brushing wet hair can sometimes result in a \"knotted, matted mess.\"\n\"Brushing is necessary — just do it gently and in the right way,\" she advised.\nPeople who have chemically treated hair are more susceptible to damage, according to experts.(iStock)\nWith her salon clients, DiMatteo recommends taking a \"gentle approach\" to hair, protecting it from heat, avoiding rough brushing and limiting chemical services.\n\"We also take time to talk about scalp health,nutrition and lifestyle, because those all play a role,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"And most importantly, don’t ever feel embarrassed or shy to speak to your stylist or local salon. We’re here to help.\"\nHAIR GROWTH COULD SLOW DOWN WITH THIS POPULAR DIET PLAN, STUDY REVEALS\nTo lower the risk of hair damage, experts recommend using a wide-tooth comb or flexible detangling brush.\nExperts recommend brushing hair from the bottom and working up to avoid damage.(iStock)\n\"The flexible bristles are great for detangling without too much tension,\" Delvecchio said. \"It’s a solid option for all hair types, as long as you’re still gentle and patient.\"\nThe salon owner also suggested using a leave-in product to help soften and hydrate the hair, making it \"much easier for the comb to glide through.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Technique matters, too – always start from the bottom and gently work your way up,\" DiMatteo advised.\nAdding heat to wet hair can \"multiply the damage,\" Erdogan warned.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nFor those with straight hair, it's best to allow it to partially air-dry before combing, according to the hair transplant surgeon.\nThe American Academy of Dermatology Association also recommends this approach.\nUsing a flexible detangling brush or wide-tooth comb is best for the hair, experts advise.(iStock)\nDelvecchio advised going \"easy on your hair\" overall, especially when it's wet.\nFor more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health.\n\"Use heat protectant, lower the heat on your tools, avoid overlapping bleach and keep up with trims,\" she suggested.\n\"Also, brush regularly (wet or dry) to prevent tangles and breakage,\" she went on. \"Hair is delicate, but with the right habits, it can staystrong and healthy.\"\nAngelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.\n",

That’s why it’s important to be checked regularly ata dentist, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nEven if your mouth feels fine, a professional may be able to pick up on smaller signals before the decay grows.\nIS OZEMPIC RUINING YOUR TEETH? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT IMPACT ON DENTAL HEALTH\nOnce the decay gets larger, there may be symptoms like toothaches, sharp pains when eating, visible holes in the teeth, staining on the surface of a tooth or pain when biting.\nCavities are holes in the teeth through which bacteria can enter.(iStock)\nDental plaque forming in the mouth is what leads to tooth decay, the process that creates cavities.\nPlaque forms whenbacteria in the mouthmixes with \"sugary or starchy food\" like milk, juice, bread and pasta, according to Cleveland Clinic.\nFLUORIDE EXPOSURE LINKED TO ‘DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS’ ON HEALTH OF PREGNANT WOMEN, INFANTS\nIf those sugars and starches are not removed from the teeth throughhealthy habits, like regular flossing and brushing after meals, bacteria begin feeding on them, the above source states.\nThe acids from bacteria strip away tooth enamel, leaving tiny openings that mark the beginning stages of a cavity. Bacteria and acid can enter through these holes and reach the vulnerable inner parts of the teeth, causing pain and more severe problems.\nIf you don’t clean sugars and starches off your teeth properly, bacteria begin feeding on them and wearing down the hard outer shell of the tooth.(iStock)\nFox News Digital previously spoke to Dr. Ricky Marshall about the impact of stomach acid and saliva production on dental health.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The amount of acid coming up and contacting the teeth will absolutely contribute to increased tooth decay,\" said Marshall, who is the owner of Stratland Dental in Glendale, Arizona, and a dentist at Wolff Family Dentistry & Orthodontics in Queen Creek, Arizona.\n\"A combination of dry mouth and increasedstomach acidcan be detrimental to teeth,\" he said.\nBRUSH, FLOSS, MOUTHWASH: DENTISTS REVEAL WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE CORRECT ORDER\nDry mouth, linked to causes like snoring and potentially certain medications, can increase the risk of tooth decay due to reduced saliva production.\n\"Your saliva clears away the acid and helps to repair the enamel,\" the CDC states on its website. \"If the repair isn't fast enough, bacteria get inside your tooth andmake cavities.\"\nSaliva helps clear away bacteria to keep plaque from forming, so it's important to treat dry mouth symptoms when they appear, experts say.(iStock)\nCleveland Clinic recommends brushing your teeth with a soft-bristled brush twice a day, and ideally after every meal.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nExperts also recommend cutting back on sugary, starchyfoods and drinks. As mentioned above, these can mix with bacteria and promote the buildup of dental plaque.\nFor more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health\n\"You should visit your dentist every year, especially to find any cavities,\" the CDC advises.\nFor small cavities, your dentist may recommend using fluoride or other products.

We have to infer that the physiologic endpoints would result in cardiovascular events.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nThe cardiologist said he agreed, however, with the conclusion that cannabis use is \"not benign.\"\n\"Chronic use does have potential cardiovascular risks,\" he warned. \"There are therapeutic uses of cannabis, and the decision to use or avoid it should be made with all benefits and risks in mind.\"\n\"We have known that the chronic use of THC-containing compounds can have negative health consequences — this study just reaffirms those prior studies,\" a cardiologist said.(iStock)\nIn general, Serwer said he cautions all of his patients to avoid any unnecessary cardiac risks.\n\"As clinicians, we must weigh the benefits and the risks of amedicine/drugor intervention,\" he said. \"If the risks outweigh the benefits, it should be avoided.\"\nFor more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health\nThe study was funded mainly by the National Institute on Drug Abuse; the California Department of Cannabis Control; the California Tobacco-Related Disease Program; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and the FDA Center for Tobacco Products.\nFox News Digital reached out to cannabis industry organizations requesting comment.\nMelissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

Theymeasured job stressand how often people kept thinking about work during their free time. Then they asked how stressed owners thought their dogs were and also tracked actual behaviors linked to canine stress, like whining, pacing or restlessness.\nWOMAN SAYS DOG DETECTED HER BREAST CANCER BEFORE DOCTORS DID: 'HE'S KNOWN THIS WHOLE TIME'\nA stressed office worker, at left, covers her face while sitting at her laptop. At right, a black Labrador retriever looks visibly anxious. A new study found that job stress can affect dogs through emotional contagion and work-related rumination.(Getty Images)\nThe study found that owners with higher job stress had dogs who showed more stress-related behaviors. That link stayed strong even when the researchers accounted for other stress in the home. Interestingly, owners didn’t always realize their dogs were stressed. It was a pup's behavior that told the story.\nThe big factor driving the connection? Rumination. Owners who mentally took work home were more likely to havestressed-out dogs. Thinking about work off the clock seemed to spread stress from humans to pets.\nThis idea is known as \"crossover,\" when one person’s stress spills over to others in a home. Previous research has shown this happens between spouses, and now there’s evidence it can happen between people and their pets too.\n10 WAYS TO TREAT YOUR PET AND CELEBRATE THEIR JOY\nA dog sits on a hardwood floor with a sad expression. New research finds that dogs can absorb their owners' work stress through emotional cues and changes in routine.(Getty Images)\nDogs are especially sensitive to their owners’ moods. Scientists call this \"emotional contagion,\" the idea that dogs can pick up on human feelings through tone of voice, body language and other subtle cues. When an owner is distracted or irritable from work stress, the dog notices. Over time, this can affect the dog’s well-being.\nThe study also suggests another explanation. When people are focused on work problems, they may become less patient, more distant or less consistent with routines like walks and feeding. That kind of change in care can also increase stress in dogs.\nA woman pinches the bridge of her nose in frustration while working from home. A 2025 study published in Scientific Reports links job stress and rumination to signs of stress in pet dogs.(Getty Images)\nThe authors point out that Americans overwhelmingly see their pets as part of the family. That makes it even more important to understand how our behavior affects them.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn the study’s words, \"employeddog ownersmight benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations when at home to protect the well-being of man’s best friend.\"\nPutting work aside when you walk through the door doesn’t just help your own health.

Following his diagnosis of a brain condition, Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts.(Getty Images)\n\"The fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid, is constantly produced in fluid-filled spaces in the center of the brain called ventricles,\" Matthew Potts, M.D., a Northwestern Medicine neurosurgeon, told Fox News Digital. (He is not involved in Joel's care.)\n\"It flows through the ventricles and then around the surface of thebrain and spinal cord, where it is then reabsorbed.\"\nHydrocephalus can happen for a variety of reasons, including infection, trauma to the brain or bleeding within the brain, the doctor said.\n\"This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus is a version of the condition that is typically seen inolder people, where the cerebrospinal fluid builds up without increasing the pressure in the brain.\nDespite the fact that pressure remains normal, NPH can impact brain function, particularly the areas of thinking, memory, movement and focus, according to Cleveland Clinic.\nThe three main effects of NPH are gait issues, urinary incontinence and cognitive difficulties. Collectively, these symptoms are known as \"Hakim’s triad.\"\nThe cognitive problems can includememory loss, slow thinking and difficulty, according to Mia Kazanjian, M.D., a board-certified radiologist in private practice based in Connecticut.\nThe five-time Grammy winner, 76, announced on Friday that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside or around the brain.(Kevin Mazur/Getty Images)\n\"This can negatively impact someone’s career and personal life, limiting the ability to do activities of daily living like eating, bathing and dressing,\" Kazanjian told Fox News Digital. \"This can also lead to emotional changes,like depression.\"\nUrinary incontinence means loss of bladder control, which can cause discomfort, anxiety and embarrassment, according to the doctor.\n\"This can predispose someone to bladder infection andskin irritation,\" she cautioned.\nMINI-STROKES MAY CAUSE SURPRISING LONG-TERM HEALTH ISSUE, EXPERTS WARN\n\"If someone has to get up in the middle of the night due to this, he or she is more likely to fall. Furthermore, it can lead someone to isolate socially, which can lead to feelings of loneliness.\"\nGait impairment means the person’s steps are unsteady, there is loss of balance, and the feet can stick to the ground, shuffle or freeze, Kazanjian said.\n\"The danger is that someone can fall and sustain trauma with a significant injury,\" she said.\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus is a version of the condition that is typically seen in older people, where the cerebrospinal fluid builds up without increasing the pressure in the brain.(iStock)\nThe condition can often be mistaken for dementia, but some cases of NPHcan be treatedand reversed.\nThe only known risk factor for NPH is age, Cleveland Clinic noted, with the average age of onset around 70.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOther factors, such as race, gender or ethnicity, do not appear to impact the chances of the condition occurring.\nApproximately 0.2% of people between 70 and 80 will develop NPH, and it affects around 5.9% of those over 80, the above source stated.\nThe condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans).(iStock)\nOnly some 0.003% of people under 65 will get the condition.\n\"About 30% of people with NPH also have Alzheimer’s disease or a similar degenerative brain disease,\" Cleveland Clinic states.\nThe condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans).\nThe most common treatment for NPH is asurgical procedurecalled \"shunting,\" in which a device with two tubes, called a shunt, is implanted to regulate the amount of fluid in the brain.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"One end is placed into a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid, usually in the ventricle in the brain or a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid in the lumbar spine below the spinal cord,\" Potts told Fox News Digital.\n\"The other end goes somewhere else in the body that can reabsorb the fluid, usually in the abdomen.\"\nThe only known risk factor for NPH is age, with the average age of onset around 70.\n\"Shunts are more complex than just a tube — there is often a valve that regulates how much fluid can flow through it.\"\nSome newer shunts can be programmed to change the rate of fluid flow from outside the body, Potts added.\nFor more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health\nSymptoms typically improve within hours or days of the shunt being implanted. The surgery itself usually entails days or weeks of recovery.\nExperts emphasized thattimely treatmentis essential to prevent severe or permanent damage to the brain from the pressure caused by the excess fluid.\nMelissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

There have been multiple versions of the test over the years — and the Army recently announced that a new version has been adopted.\nOn June 1, 2025, the military branch will roll out its newArmy Fitness Test(AFT) as a replacement for the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT).\nWALKING CERTAIN NUMBER OF STEPS DAILY REDUCES CANCER RISK, OXFORD STUDY FINDS\nThe new test — based on \"18 months of data analysis and feedback from thousands of test iterations\" — will introduce updated scoring standards that emphasize \"readiness and combat effectiveness,\" according to an Army press release.\nSoldiers will have until Jan. 1, 2026, to meet the new AFT requirements without facing \"adverse actions.\"\nThe U.S. Army requires that all active-duty soldiers prove their physical prowess by passing a rigorous fitness test.(iStock)\nAFT scores are recorded duringbasic training for soldiersand initial training for officers, the Army states on its website.\nActive-duty soldiers are required to complete the test twice a year, while soldiers in the Army Reserve and Army National Guard must record scores once a year.\nEXERCISE CAN PREVENT COGNITIVE DECLINE EVEN WHEN ENERGY LAGS, RESEARCHERS DISCOVER\n\"The AFT is designed to improve soldier readiness and ensurephysical standards[and] prepare soldiers for the demands of modern warfare,\" said Sgt. Maj. Christopher Mullinax, senior enlisted leader, deputy chief of staff for Operations, Army Headquarters, in the release.\n\"It emphasizes holistic fitness over event-specific training and is grounded in performance.\"\n\"The AFT is designed to improve soldier readiness and ensure physical standards [and] prepare soldiers for the demands of modern warfare.\"\nScoring requirements are more demanding for the new test, with soldiers in combat roles held to the highest standards.\n\"Combat standards are sex-neutral for the 21 direct combat roles, a change designed to ensure fairness and operational readiness,\" the release states.\nThe AFT consists of the following five events, as described on the Army’s website.\nIn this challenge, the soldier must lift the maximum weight possible three times using a 60-pound hex bar and plates.\nThis move assesses muscular strength, balance and flexibility.\nArmy soldiers must complete a timed two-mile run on a flat outdoor course in a test of aerobic endurance.(iStock)\n\"Deadlifts require a person to recruit glute and hamstring strength in order to lift a barbell off the ground to waist height,\" said Miles Hill, a certified personal trainer andboxing instructorat Rumble in New York City. \"It is the most effective technique for picking heavy weights off the ground.\"\nThe deadlift can also be dangerous for civilians if they use improper form, warned Dr. Hooman Melamed, an orthopedic spine surgeon and sport medicine expert from Beverly Hills.\n\"It’s doable — but only with smart, progressive training.\"\n\"If your posture or form is off, the risk to your lower back and hips is high — it could be a career-ending injury for some,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nThe soldier must complete as many hand-release push-ups as possible in two minutes, using proper technique.\n\"Hand release push-ups require a person to drop all the way to the ground, lift their hands in the air for a second, and then push themselves back up to high plank,\" said Hill, who is also a second-degree black belt in Taekwondo.\nNYPD DETECTIVE SHARES GRUELING WORKOUTS TO MOTIVATE COPS TO GET IN SHAPE\nMelamed noted that while hand-release push-ups are great for building upper body strength, if the person is not already strong, the sudden force can damage the shoulders.\nThe hand-release push-up testsmuscular enduranceand flexibility.\nWith the sprint-drag-carry (SDC), the soldier is tasked with completing five 50-meter shuttles (sprint, drag, lateral, carry, sprint) as quickly as possible, using two 40-pound kettlebells and a 90-pound sled.\n\"The sprint-drag-carry is probably the toughest sequence here, since it requires explosive strength, muscular endurance andcardiovascular endurance,\" Hill said.\n\"Combat standards are sex-neutral for the 21 direct combat roles, a change designed to ensure fairness and operational readiness,\" the Army's release states.(Cecilie_Arcurs)\nMelamed calls the SDC a \"brutal test of speed and explosive power.\"\n\"If you're not conditioned, tearing a hamstring or pulling something mid-run can happen,\" he said.\nThe soldier must maintain a proper plank position for as long as possible, testing muscular endurance and balance.\n\"A plank is an ultimate test of corestrength and endurance, as it requires a person to hold their body weight for as long as they can,\" said Hill. \"It can be challenging, but it is the time requirement that determines the challenge.\"\nCRUNCHES BY AGE: HERE'S HOW MANY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO\nMelamed noted that while this move looks simple, holding a proper plank for time is extremely challenging. \"It exposes weaknesses in the back, core and shoulder girdle.\"\nThe soldier must complete a timedtwo-mile runon a flat outdoor course in a test of aerobic endurance.\n\"Two-mile runs are relatively easy for any able-bodied human — however, the time constraints are what make it challenging,\" Hill said.\nWith the sprint-drag-carry (SDC), the soldier is tasked with completing five 50-meter shuttles (sprint, drag, lateral, carry, sprint) as quickly as possible, using two 40-pound kettlebells and a 90-pound sled.(iStock)\nThe standing power throw event, which was part of the previous version of the test, is no longer included as a requirement.\n\"We eliminated the standing power throw because it wasn't effectively promoting fitness and readiness as well as we would like,\" Mullinax said.\n\"Furthermore, it presented an elevated risk of overuse injury and encouraged soldiers to focus on technique rather than demonstrating true power.\"\nThe toughness of a workout or fitness test is relative to the overall fitness of an individual, according to Dr. Jason Perry, M.D., primary caresports medicine physicianwith Baptist Health Orthopedic Care in Deerfield Beach, Florida.\nSTAY FIT IN YOUR 40S AND BEYOND WITH THESE SMART WORKOUT TIPS\n\"Generally speaking, the AFT is challenging, but not impossible for the average person with a basic fitness foundation,\" Perry, who is unaffiliated with the Army, told Fox News Digital.\n\"It’s designed to test full-body strength, muscular endurance, speed, agility and cardiovascular stamina — all elements essential for combat readiness, but also relevant tofunctional fitnessfor civilians.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nCompared to a typical gym workout, the AFT is more demanding because it combines different physical domainsinto one test, he said.\n\"Compared to elite athletic training, it’s moderate — but not easy,\" Perry added.\nIn the three-repetition maximum deadliftIn this challenge, the soldier must lift the maximum weight possible three times using a 60-pound hex bar and plates.(iStock)\nFor civilians who regularly strength train, run or do functional workouts (like CrossFit or HIIT), this test is well within reach, he said.\nFor a civilian who exercises three to four times a week, the AFT is \"realistically achievable\" with focused training over an eight- to 12-week period.\n\"About 30 to 50% of healthy, recreationally active adults could likely pass it with little to moderate training,\" he predicted. \"Sedentary adults or those withchronic conditionswould have a harder time and would likely need a focused eight- to 12-week (or possibly longer) conditioning plan to pass.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS

When those androgens are reduced or blocked, the cancer stops growing.\nDr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, said the hormone-sensitive designation doesn’t necessarily mean Biden has already been taking hormone therapies, which is unknown.\nGLEASON SCORE FOR PROSTATE CANCER: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BIDEN'S DIAGNOSIS\n\"You can tell under a microscope if this is the type of cancer that could respond to hormone therapy, but no matter what it looks like, you don’t know until you try it,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"And sometimes it looks like there will be an effect, but it ends up being resistant to therapy.\"\nThe former president’s prostate cancer has been characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (grade group 5) with \"metastasis to the bone.\"(AP/Evan Vucci)\nProstate cancer has long been known to feed on the male hormone testosterone, according to Dr. Bilal Siddiqui, M.D., a medical oncologist and prostate cancer researcher at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\"The overwhelming majority of prostate cancers — 99% plus — are hormone-sensitive and dependent on testosterone in the beginning,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"I would say it’s a very reasonable assumption [of hormone sensitivity], but we would know definitively once hormone therapy has started.\"\n\"The overwhelming majority of prostate cancers are hormone-sensitive and dependent on testosterone in the beginning.\"\nThe backbone of treatment for any metastatic prostate cancer is \"androgen deprivation therapy,\" which is geared toward decreasing the body's level of testosterone.\n\"Typically, when you start the androgen deprivation therapy, testosterone levels will decrease and the PSA levels will decrease along with it, and that's your definitive proof that the cancer is hormone-sensitive,\" Siddiqui said.\nThe backbone of treatment for any metastatic prostate cancer is \"androgen deprivation therapy,\" which is geared toward decreasing the body's level of testosterone.(iStock)\nHistorically, androgen (hormone) deprivation therapy was done surgically through removal of the testes — but today’s typical methods include pills or injections, according to the oncologist.\n\"That eliminates about 80 to 85% of the testosterone that's produced in the body,\" he said.\nIn many cases, doctors may add other drugs to block testosterone from secondary sources in the body, such as the adrenal glands that sit above the kidneys.\nNEW PROSTATE CANCER TEST PINPOINTS DISEASE BETTER THAN PSA OPTION, STUDY FINDS\nNorth Carolina family physician Dr. Alexa Mieses Malchuk reiterated that prostate cancer that shrinks or slows in progression after blocking testosterone qualifies as hormone-sensitive.\n\"This means that it grows or shrinks in relation to how much androgen or testosterone is circulating in the body,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"Typically, when you start the androgen deprivation therapy, testosterone levels will decrease and the PSA levels will decrease along with it, and that's your definitive proof that the cancer is hormone-sensitive,\" an oncologist said.(iStock)\n\"If you suppress testosterone and the cancer does not shrink and continues to grow or spread, then the cancer is independent of the amount of hormone circulating in the body.\"\nThere are a number of different ways to monitor disease progression, but it’s most commonly done by a combination of PSA blood tests and imaging studies, the doctor noted.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nEventually, metastatic prostate cancer will progress to become hormone-resistant, which means it no longer responds to hormone therapy, according to Siddiqui.\n\"It can vary in how long it takes to get to that point,\" the oncologist said. \"It's usually a couple of years before it evolves from hormone-sensitive to hormone-resistant.\"\nThe \"ultimate test\" of whether cancer has become hormone-resistant is to lower testosterone levels and observe where the cancer goes, he noted.\n\"It's usually a couple of years before it evolves from hormone-sensitive to hormone-resistant.\"\nThere may also signs of the disease getting worse.\n\"That might mean a rising PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test, new pain or symptoms, or new tumors that show up on the scan,\" Siddiqui told Fox News Digital.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states that men aged 55 to 69 years should have the option to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening to monitor for prostate cancer.\n\"Before deciding whether to be screened, men should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision,\" the USPSTF states.\nSiegel questioned this guidance to skip screening for older men.\nFor more Health articles,

This often leaves patients feeling drained or fatigued.\"\nIncreased inflammation:This can occur due to the immune response following a TIA.\nReduced levels of chemicals like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine can result in depression, fatigue or lack of motivation.(iStock)\nLower levels of neurotransmitters in the brain:Reduced levels of chemicals like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine canresult in depression, fatigue or lack of motivation, according to Serwer.\nSleep disturbances:\"These are very common after a stroke and can lead to significant sleep deprivation,\" the cardiologist said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMedications:Drugs used to treat strokes may have adverse side effects, including fatigue. \"Betablockers are excellentblood pressure medicationsand are often prescribed after a stroke or heart attack, but they may cause notable fatigue,\" Serwer noted.\nOther factors:\"Simple tasks may require more mental effort than before the injury,\" the cardiologist said. \"Depression or anxiety after a stroke can also be a confounding predictor of fatigue.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nThe study did have some limitations, the researchers noted.\n\"It is anobservational studyand therefore we cannot determine causality,\" Modrau said.\n\"Results are based on self-reported questionnaires, and we cannot be certain that relatives didn’t help fill them out or influence results.\"\nDrugs used to treat strokes may have adverse side effects, including fatigue.(iStock)\nThe researchers also did not have information on pre-TIA fatigue levels, although previous studies suggested that it was \"much more frequent\" after mini-strokes.\nLooking ahead, Modrau said she hopeshealthcare providersbegin to acknowledge lasting fatigue after TIA and provide care pathways for these patients.\nFor more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health\n\"Up until now, patients with lasting challenges after TIA have been left alone in many cases,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"We as a society should start to acknowledge their difficulties instead of viewing them as ‘the lucky ones,’\" she continued. \"My aim with this study has been to give these patients a voice – and to start to listen to their struggles.\"\nMelissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

    "body": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses President Donald Trump’s possible 25% tariff on overseas medication and a new study on the relationship between Ozempic and dementia risk on ‘America Reports.’\nWeight-loss medicationsknown as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, which have gained popularity for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, have been shown to have the surprising secondary benefit of reducing alcohol intake.\nA team of international researchers from Ireland and Saudi Arabia followed 262 adult patients with obesity who started taking two GLP-1 medications: liraglutide or semaglutide.\nAmong the regular drinkers, weeklyalcohol intakedecreased by 68%, from approximately 23 units of alcohol to around 8 units.\nWEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES DRUGS CAN CAUSE MOOD CHANGES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BEHAVIORAL SIDE EFFECTS\nThe findings were recently published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism and were also presented last week at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain.\nGLP-1 agonists mimic a hormone called GLP-1, which is released from thegastrointestinal systemafter eating, according to study co-author Carel Le Roux, a professor at University College Dublin.\nWeight-loss medications known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists have been shown to have the surprising secondary benefit of reducing alcohol intake.(iStock)\nThese medications activate GLP-1 receptors in the brain, decreasing the sense of \"reward\" people feel after eating or drinking, eventually leading to reduced cravings for both food and alcohol, he told Fox News Digital.\n\"It is this commonality of function that suggests the GLP-1 receptors in the brain may be a therapeutic target for not just the disease of obesity, but also for alcohol use disorder,\" the professor said.\nBefore the participants started the weight-loss drugs, they self-reported their weeklyalcohol intake, then were categorized as non-drinkers, rare drinkers or regular drinkers.\nApproximately 72% had at least two follow-up visits and 68% reported regular alcohol consumption.\nWEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS’ IMPACT ON CANCER RISK REVEALED IN NEW STUDY\nAfter starting the weight-loss medications, the participants’ weekly average alcohol intake decreased by almost two-thirds overall — from approximately 11 units of alcohol to four units after four months of treatment with the GLP-1 agonists.\nThe reduction in alcohol use was comparable to the decrease that can be achieved by nalmefene, a drug that decreases the \"buzz\" feeling in people with alcohol use disorder in Europe, according to the researchers.\nAmong the regular drinkers, weekly alcohol intake decreased by 68%, from approximately 23 units of alcohol to around 8 units.(iStock)\nFor the 188 patients who were followed over an average of four months, none had increased their alcohol intake after starting theweight-loss medications.\nPatients reported that after an evening meal, they were too full to have their usual drink — and when they did drink, they reported becoming full extremely quickly and drinking at a slower pace, Le Roux noted.\n\"The findings in this study suggest that we may have just found a therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder.\"\nThis suggests that the experience was less enjoyable, partly due to the reduced rate of alcohol absorption.\nSome patients also reported that they didn’t enjoy the flavor of thealcoholic beveragesas much, and also that hangovers were much worse.\nAll of these experiences showed that the weight-loss medications create \"guard rails\" that prevent most patients from drinking excessively, giving them a degree of control over their alcohol intake, according to Le Roux.\nAfter starting the weight-loss medications, the participants’ weekly average alcohol intake decreased by almost two-thirds overall.(iStock)\n\"The findings in this study suggest that we may have just found atherapeutic targetfor alcohol use disorder — the GLP-1 receptor,\" the professor told Fox News Digital.\n\"This finding potentially opens the possibility of an entirely new pharmacological treatment paradigm, which could be used in conjunction with conventional methods, such asbehavior therapyand group support.\"\nThe study was limited by its relatively small number of patients, the researchers acknowledged.\nAlso, the researchers were not able to verify the participants’ self-reported alcohol intake, and roughly one-third of them were not available for follow-up.\nSEMAGLUTIDE FOUND TO HAVE SHOCKING BENEFIT FOR LIVER DISEASE PATIENTS IN NEW STUDY\nThere was also no control group, which means the researchers couldn’t prove that taking weight-loss medication reduces alcohol intake.\nThe main advantage of GLP-1 agonists is that they only need to be taken once a week and continue to work for the entire week.(iStock)\n\"Randomized,controlled trialswith diverse patient populations — including patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder — are needed to provide the quality and quantity of data that could be used to support an application for licensing the medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorder,\" Le Roux said.\n(One such trial is currently underway in Denmark.)\nWith the current medications available to treat alcohol use disorder, the \"major problem\" is compliance, Le Roux said — \"because the cravings for alcohol tend to come in waves.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"This means a patient might be fully committed to treatment at one point in the week, but then stop taking the medication later in the week when a craving comes,\" the professor added.\n\"This research suggests a promising ancillary benefit of GLP-1 analogs, potentially influencing cravings for alcohol and offering a new avenue for managing alcohol use disorder,\" a physician said.(iStock)\nThere are currently three FDA-approved medications to treat alcohol use disorder: naltrexone (which helps decrease cravings by reducing the \"buzz\" feeling that comes with drinking alcohol); disulfiram (which helps some people avoid alcohol by making them feel sick when they drink), and acamprosate (which restores the balance ofhormones in the brainto reduce cravings), according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nBut less than 10% of people with alcohol use disorder get the proper treatment, with many resuming use within the first year of treatment, past research shows.\nThe main advantage of the GLP-1 agonists is that

a promising ancillary benefit of GLP-1 analogs, potentially influencing cravings for alcohol and offering a new avenue for managing alcohol use disorder,\" Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford,obesity medicine physicianat Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who was not part of the study, told Fox News Digital.\nFor more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health\n\"While the exact

(Patel was not involved in the study.)\n\"The anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers.\"\n\"Bottom line: Obesity can cause certain cancers, andtreatment of obesitywith GLP1-RA reduces the risk of only obesity-related cancers.\"\nDr. Britta Reierson, MD, medical director of knownwell, a provider of metabolic health services, said there are several ways in which GLP-1 RAs could have cancer mitigation properties.\n\"First, the anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers,\" the Minnesota-based doctor, who also was not part of the research, told Fox News Digital.\nOverall, the study determined that \"the direct effect of GLP1-RAs compared to BMS on the risk for ORC beyond their effects on weight-loss is estimated as 41% relative risk reduction.\"(iStock)\n\"Second, the metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reducecancer risk.\"\nEmerging evidence also suggests that GLP-1 RAs may have direct anti-tumor effects, Reierson noted — \"potentially through modulation of immune responses and epigenetic changes (changes that occur to gene expression and are passed down to future generations).\"\nFIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL\nResearch suggests that GLP-1 medications help reduce inflammation not just through weight loss, but also in other organs of the body, such asthe heart, according to Dr. Susan Savery, MD, a board-certified obesity medicine and primary care physician with PlushCare, a virtual health platform offering primary care, therapy and weight management services.\n\"Over time, chronic inflammation can be a risk factor for cancer development, as it may damage cell DNA,\" San Francisco-based Savery, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.\n\"The metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\"(iStock)\n\"Our fat cells (adipose tissue) naturally produce inflammatory cells, and GLP-1 medications, similar to bariatric surgery, help reduce this inflammation by decreasing the amount of adipose tissue through weight loss.\"\nThe study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.\n\"First, it is an observational study. It means that our comparison groups (persons who had surgery versus those who received GLP1-RAs) may still have some residual differences, despite our methodological efforts,\" Sagy told Fox News Digital.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"However, only this type of real-lifeobservational studycan provide the long follow-up period that is necessary to evaluate the risk of developing cancer, which often has very long latency periods.\"\nAnother limitation is that the primary drug included in the study was liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), with smaller numbers of people taking exenatide (Byetta) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).\nWhile GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\"(iStock)\n\"It will be important to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the newer GLP1-RA drugs, which are expected to have a larger effect,\" Sagy said.\n\"Although the direction of the results is promising, we should wait and see if and how clinical guidelines will consider it.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nReierson agreed that muchmore researchis needed before GLP-1 RAs could ever be considered as cancer prevention options.\n\"Larger, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to confirm the observed effects and better understand the underlying mechanisms,\" she said.\n\"It will also be important to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on different types of cancer and assess the long-term safety and potential side effects of using GLP-1 RAs as a cancer therapy.\"(American Cancer Society/Getty Images)\n\"It will also be important to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on different types of cancer and assess the long-term safety and potential side effects of using GLP-1 RAs as a cancer therapy.\"\nSavery agrees that it’s likely too early to predict FDA approval for cancer therapy, but noted that \"weight reduction plays an important role in cancer prevention, and GLP-1s seem to offer an additional benefit through inflammation reduction.\"\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\nWhile GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining ahealthy lifestylethrough nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\"\nMelissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

    "body": "Foundation for Defense of Democracy CEO Mark Dubowitz joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Iran's weapons capability and Israel's defense system.\nBeneath the rugged face of Mount Alvand near the religious city of Qom lies the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant—an underground stronghold and centerpiece ofIran’s nuclear ambitions.Though presented as a civilian facility, Fordow is widely believed by Israeli intelligence to be the probable heart of Tehran’s covert atomic weapons effort.\nFor years, the Islamic Republic has played a dangerous game—enriching uranium just below weapons-grade, obstructing International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) oversight, and using regional instability as a shield for its ambitions. While Israel has confronted nuclear threats before, it lacks the bunker-busting capability to neutralize Fordow. That responsibility now falls to the United States. The case for destroying Fordow is not only strong—it is urgent.\nISRAEL-IRAN CONFLICT: LIVE UPDATES\nFordow: The Core of Iran’s Nuclear Calculus\nIran’s nuclear infrastructure includes various sites: Natanz, which is more exposed; Arak, partly repurposed; and Esfahan and Parchin, both key research locations. But Fordow stands apart. It is buried under nearly 80 meters of rock and hosts advanced IR-6 centrifuges capable of enriching uranium at accelerated rates. The site is engineered to survive conventional airstrikes and represents Iran’s strategic bet on invulnerability.\nONLY THE US MILITARY CAN TAKE OUT IRAN’S ‘MOST DANGEROUS’ NUCLEAR SITE\nWestern intelligence exposed Fordow in 2009 after years of concealment.Prime Minister Netanyahuwarned that Iran’s leaders \"have backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a nuclear weapons program,\" and cautioned, \"if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year. It could be within a few months, less than a year.\" While he told Business Insider that Israel’s strike hit \"the core of Iran’s nuclear weaponization infrastructure,\" he acknowledged that Israel \"lacks the heavy bunker-busting munitions\" needed to destroy sites like Fordow.\nFordow is not just another enrichment site—it is a fortified monument to Iran’s deception and determination. The United States alone has the tools and reach to destroy it.\nIAEA Director GeneralRafael Grossi confirmedin 2024 that Iran now possesses enough uranium enriched to 60%—a technical heartbeat away from weapons-grade levels—to build several nuclear devices. He warned that theIAEA lacked sufficient transparencyin Iran’s nuclear activities and cautioned that \"without full Iranian cooperation, the agency cannot verify that its program is peaceful.\"\nA Pattern of Deception—and Alarm\nIn 2018, Mossad operatives seized 55,000 documents from a Tehran warehouse revealing a covert nuclear weapons program known as \"Project Amad.\"David Albrightof the Institute for Science and International Security assessed the material as \"clear evidence that Iran intended to produce five nuclear weapons.\"\nIAEA CHIEF CALLS ISRAELI PRESIDENT, REPORTEDLY SAYS IRAN NUCLEAR FACILITY WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED\nDespite the JCPOA framework, Iran continues nuclear-related activity at undeclared sites—Turquzabad, Marivan, and Varamin—where IAEA inspectors have found traces of nuclear material without explanation. These discoveries point to a sustained weapons agenda.\nIn 2023, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.Herzi Halevi warnedthat \"negative developments regarding Iran’s nuclear program\" could compel Israel to act. His predecessor, Lt. Gen.Aviv Kochavi,was more blunt: \"Iran today has enough enriched material to produce four nuclear bombs, three at 20 percent and one at 60 percent.\"\nDespite the threat, Israel cannot strike Fordow effectively. As Israeli AmbassadorYechiel Leiter admitted, \"We may be able to strike Natanz, but we cannot reach Fordow without American support.\"\nHow the U.S. Would Strike—and Why It Must\nThe U.S. military possesses the capability to neutralize Fordow.The GBU-57A/BMassive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP)—a 30,000-pound bunker-buster—is designed for hardened targets like Fordow. Dropped from a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, it can penetrate 60 feet of reinforced concrete or hundreds of feet of soil and rock. Multiple MOPs delivered in a precision, double-tap pattern could collapse Fordow’s structure entirely.\nA strike package would likely include:\nBut the mission cannot stop at detonation. The United States must insist on independent verification that Fordow is irreparably disabled. This could includeIAEA inspection—if permitted—or the use of American intelligence capabilities to gather imagery, seismic data, and on-ground confirmation. A successful strike means little unless the world can verify the result.\nOsirak Revisited: Lessons from 1981\nIn 1981, Israel destroyed Iraq’s Osirak reactor in Operation Opera. Then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin stated, \"Never again will we allow an enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction against the Jewish people.\" Although initially condemned, the strike was later vindicated when the Gulf War revealedSaddam Hussein’s persistent nuclear ambitions.\nTRUMP FACES CRITICAL DECISION AS MIDDLE EAST TEETERS ON BRINK OF WAR\nThe U.S. now stands where Israel once stood—facing a critical threat with limited time. Delay may allow Iran to build a bomb, fortify alternative sites, or export nuclear know-how to its proxies in Lebanon,Syria, or Yemen.\nWhat If We Don’t Strike?\nOpponents of military action argue it could spark a regional war, drive up oil prices, or embolden Iran’s hardliners. Those are serious risks—but not greater than allowing a fanatical regime to field nuclear weapons. Iran has already threatened retaliation, but its escalation capacity is checked by economic fragility, internal dissent, and the specter of overwhelming U.S. retaliation.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAsHenry Kissingeronce observed, \"The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequence before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil.\" Deterrence must be credible—and credibility, at times, requires action.\nFailure to act would embolden other nuclear aspirants. FromNorth Koreato China, rogue regimes are watching. A nuclear Iran would almost certainly provoke proliferation across the Middle East, triggering a regional arms race with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt.\nThe Cost of Inaction\nStriking Fordow will not erase Iran’s nuclear knowledge. But it will cripple its most secure facility, set the program back years, and signal that the U.S. will act when global stability is on the line. The alternative is a future where Iran detonates a bomb in secret and confronts the world from a position of strength—and impunity.\nThat scenario would force the U.S. into a larger and bloodier war; one fought under the shadow of anuclear threat.\nConclusion\nFordow is not just another enrichment site—it is a fortified monument to Iran’s deception and determination.The United Statesalone has the tools and reach to destroy it. This mission, if undertaken, must be precise, overwhelming, and independently verified.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe clock is ticking. Each month Iran delays inspection, each trace of material found at an undeclared site, each rhetorical threat, inches us closer to the point of no return.\nHistory will judge our resolve. Let it be said that when the mountain hid the bomb, America shattered the mountain—and proved it.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ROBERT MAGINNIS\nRobert Maginnis is a retired US Army officer and the author of 12 books, including his most recent, \"Preparing for World War III\" (2024).\n",

Allen & his party is just arrived from St. Johns, when they were attacked,\" Arnold's letter read. \"[And they] were obliged to make a precipitate retreat … They have returned without provision & much fatigued.\"\nIn his reply, Stevens wrote that more provisions were on the way to support American forces, despite difficulties with enlistments.\n\"He had helped capture Fort Ticonderoga, and had already sailed north and attacked another British post at St. Jean in Québec.\"\n\"[T]he City of Albany and Country are sending in provisions continually … I am informed there is a great quantity more coming from different parts of the country,\" he wrote.\nWORLD WAR II HERO'S SPECIAL MEMENTO FINALLY COMES HOME TO HIS FAMILY AFTER 80 YEARS\nSpeaking to Fox News Digital, Fort Ticonderoga curator Matthew Keagle stressed that the letters were written long before Arnold famously defected to the British.\n\"At the time these letters were written, Arnold was less than two weeks into consolidating control over Ticonderoga and Crown Point,\" the historian noted.\nThe British fort was captured by American forces in May 1775, delivering a blow to King George III's forces.(Getty Images)\n\"He had helped capture Fort Ticonderoga, andhad already sailed northand attacked another British post at St. Jean in Québec, capturing more redcoats and the only British sloop on Lake Champlain.\"\nKeagle also noted the rivalry between Arnold and Allen.\nAlthough Allen commanded the mighty Green Mountain Boys militia during the expedition, Arnold was the only one with official government authorization from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety.\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\"This was a tense alliance, and it collapsed the day after the capture [of Fort Ticonderoga],\" Keagle said.\n\"Arnold tried to assert control over what he saw as unruly pilfering of the garrison’s supplies and a lack of discipline and preparations.\"\nFort Ticonderoga, shown here, was the scene of many battles during the French and Indian War, as well as during the American Revolution.(Getty Images)\nHe added, \"His departure to attack St. Jean got him away, and he and Allen did not serve together again.\"\nAnd who exactly was Stevens, Arnold's less-famous correspondent?\nKeagle said that while Stevens \"is not a familiar name,\" he played an active role in thefight for independence.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\"After Fort Ticonderoga was taken, Stevens came to Fort George at the southern end of Lake George, and commanded the forces there through July 1775,\" Keagle noted.\n\"He was later commissioned as a captain in a Connecticut regiment and was captured by the British at the Battle of the Cedars in May of 1776 in Canada.\"\nThe Arnold letter was recently given to the museum in memory of a former trustee.\nInterestingly, the letters have not been this physically close together since Stevens wrote his response to Arnold's letter in May 1775.\nStevens' letter has been in the possession of Fort Ticonderoga for decades, but the Arnold letter wasrecently given to the museumin memory of former trustee George M. Jones.\nThe letters that have been brought together were written long before Benedict Arnold defected to the British in 1780.(Getty Images)\nRather than being on display in an exhibit, the letters are part of the \"Ticonderoga’s Treasures of 1775\" experience; Keagle is bringing guests face-to-face with original documents and artifacts from Ticonderoga’s collections.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe recently unified letters reflect the significant rolethat New York stateplayed during the American Revolution.\nIn a similar venture, the New York State Museum recently began displaying a Revolutionary War-era ship at its Albany headquarters, around 100 miles south of Ticonderoga.\nAndrea Margolis is a lifestyle writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

The site, the Sanctuary of Apollo at Frangissa, was first discovered in the 19th century before it was subsequently lost, the group said.\nApollo, the god of archery and the son of Zeus, was venerated both in Ancient Greece andAncient Rome. He was one of the 12 Olympian deities in Greek mythology, said to have lived upon Mount Olympus along with his father Zeus and sister Artemis.\nARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH STRANGE HEAD DEPICTING ROMAN GOD BENEATH CATHOLIC BASILICA\nA German archaeologist named Max Ohnefalsch-Richter found the sanctuary in 1885, which the Department of Antiquities described as \"one of the most spectacular finds of his time.\"\n\"[It was] arichly furnished rural sanctuaryof Apollo,\" said the post, which was translated from Greek to English. \"It was furnished with a lavish abundance of votive statues numbering in the hundreds, some of which were of colossal dimensions.\"\nMassive statues and inscriptions dating back 2,700 years were recently discovered at an ancient sanctuary in Cyprus.(Cyprus Department of Antiquities)\nBut the 19th-century excavation was hastily done — and Ohnefalsch-Richter covered the sanctuary up with dirt to preserve it. It was soon forgotten.\n\"As the excavator completely covered the sanctuary, including the statue bases and walls, its location was eventually forgotten,\" the Facebook post noted.\nARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER WELL-PRESERVED TEMPLE, CULT CENTER DATING BACK TO ANCIENT EGYPT\nGerman archaeologists began a new search for the site in 2021. It was eventually found, and the latest excavation of the site recently wrapped up.\nThis year, excavators found numerous statues of massive proportions, as well as votive statues that were found in the backfill area from 1885.\nThe sanctuary site was discovered in 1885 before it was reburied and forgotten about.(Cyprus Department of Antiquities)\n\"In the process, the walls of the dedication courtyard and over 100 statue bases, some of colossal size, were uncovered in large areas,\" the department said.\n\"Apparently in 1885 [the votive statues] were not recognized as artifacts in the rush,\" the post continued. \"They fundamentally expand our knowledge ofthis sacred place.\"\nArchaeologists also recently found \"completely new types of statues\" that were previously unknown.

(Credit: Brian and Kevin Martin via Pen News)\nUnderwater archaeologistsmay have discovered a long-lost 18th-century treasure ship that vanished over two centuries ago.\nMarine expert Edmond O’Byrne told Pen News that his team found what is believed to be the Recovery, a British ship that was lost off the coast of Wexford, Ireland, in 1787.(See the video at the top of this article.)\nThe ship carried various treasures, and its cargo included a large quantity of marble and bronze. James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont, collected the valuable materials during a tour of Europe.\nHAUNTING SLAVE SHIPS FOUND OFF COAST OF NATIONAL PARK 300 YEARS LATER: 'VERY CONVINCING'\nThe ship also carried rare art and natural curiosities owned by John La Touche, one of the wealthiest Irish bankers of his time.\nBut the ship met its end when it sank 85 miles south of Dublin, itsintended destination.

    "body": "Photography by Gregory Miller\nWe’re more than a hundred feet under Beckley, West Virginia, when the lights go out. One minute, I’m scanning the roof bolts and support timbers above my head, and then, with athunk, there’s just . . . nothing. Nothing but the faint drip of water down the rock walls. Gerald Lucas asks me to put my hand out. I can’t see it, or him. It’s only 58 degrees—the temperature underground is constant all year—but I shiver a little. Oblivion is disorienting.\n“That’s how dark it is inside a coal mine,” Lucas says. He waits a few seconds, then thumbs the power switch back on.\nLucas is 74, with close-cropped white hair, a neatly trimmed goatee, and a voice that curls around vowels in a way you don’t hear much anymore. That he can do this at all—flip a switch—is something he never takes for granted. Back in 1972, when he first picked up a No. 4 coal shovel and entered the mines like his father before him, roughly half of America’s electricity came from coal. He worked underground for the next 45 years, often twelve hours a day, six days a week. It was one of the world’s most physically brutal, dangerous jobs. He still bears the scar on his neck from a piece of machinery that nearly strangled him. But every day brought a new sense of discovery, and eventually mining got into his blood. “Every time you take the coal out of there,” he says, “you’ve been somewhere no one’s ever been before.”\nThen the world changed, and miners like Lucas had to change with it.\nEnergy companies have increasingly shifted toward natural gas and renewable technologies (solar, wind, and hydroelectric power), while coal production in the United States has plummeted. It now accounts for less than 20 percent of American electricity. While this has been good news for the environment—coal is a major source of carbon emissions—it has also eliminated tens of thousands ofjobs. Communities across the Appalachian coalfields in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia have been forced to adapt, and many of them, like Beckley, are finding new hope in tourism.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhen Lucas dons his blue coveralls and hard hat these days, it’s as a guide for Beckley’s Exhibition Coal Mine, which last year drew roughly 55,000 visitors and made almost $1 million in revenue—a vital boost for a town where more than a quarter of its 16,600 residents live in poverty. But the transition to tourism hasn’t always been seamless or easy. When Lucas retired from his government job as a mine safety inspector six years ago, the average salary for a veteran miner approached six figures. His federal benefits weren’t enough to cover his expenses, so he had to find another job. Now he makes $10 an hour. “If you don’t work in the mining industry,” he says, shaking his head, “you don’t make any money.”\nStill, Lucas takes great pride in teaching people about the history of American mining (in 2023, he even met country star Brad Paisley, who filmed a music video underground). He ushers visitors into small carts, or “mantrips,” steers them into the mine, and shows them artifacts from years past, such as the old canary cages used by miners to detect poisonous gases and the carbide headlamps miners wore in the early 20th century. “Most people that come through here have no clue where their power comes from,” he says. “They have nocluewhat those miners went through just to provide that electricity.”\n● ● ●\nIn this part of the world, it all begins with geology.\nAlmost nothing in southern West Virginia is flat. Even in the larger towns, houses teeter on the hillsides and the roads wind through valleys wreathed in fog. It’s as if God crushed this part of America in his fist, compressing ancient swamps into jagged shale and sandstone ridges. These are among the oldest mountains on earth, and the New River, which carves through them, is the world’s second-oldest major waterway (the first is the Nile). Some of the planet’s richest seams of high-quality, bituminous coal run underneath this imposing terrain.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coal mined from the New River Gorge powered American industry. Without it, there would have been no electricity, no steel for skyscrapers, no fuel for battleships. But that came at a heavy cost to the land itself. A frenzy of mining and logging stripped this region bare starting in 1873, when the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway connected the upper and lower gorge, and coal camps and boomtowns sprang up nearly every half mile along the river.\nLooking out over the New River Gorge today from its soaring single-arch steel bridge (a half-hour northeast of Beckley), it’s hard to imagine the heart of America’s newest national park as anything other than pristine wilderness. The dramatic landscape that once made this region so appealing to extractive industries now makes it a haven for ecologists and outdoor adventure-seekers. The gorge plunges from roughly 900 feet to 1,400 feet at its deepest point, creating dozens of microclimates for diverse plant and animal species. Steep drops on the New River and its neighbor, the Gauley, also form some of the region’s most thrilling Class IV and V rapids for whitewater enthusiasts. For hikers and mountain bikers, there are a hundred-plus miles of trails cross-hatching the dense forests, and dizzying sandstone cliffs are perfect for rock-climbing and bouldering.\nPhoto by Holly Wolff\nRemnants of the park’s industrial history still exist, though, if you know where to look. Visitors can explore the old coal tipple at Nuttallburg, owned by Henry Ford, and the coke ovens in the lower gorge. The boomtown of Thurmond, once only accessible by rail, looks much the same as it did in 1910, when it boasted several hotels, department stores, and banks. (Legend has it that one poker game at Thurmond’s Dunglen Hotel lasted 14 years.)\nAs mining technology advanced in the mid 20th century, the coal companies began to move on. Starting in the late 1960s, several whitewater-rafting outfitters entered the scene. This marked the first notable shift from coal extraction to tourism infusion, and it came with growing pains. Running a viable rafting business required river guides to bus visitors to and from the river, often through fairly small, quiet communities. “There were people who didn’t like the rafting industryat all,” says Visit Southern West Virginia Director Lisa Strader, who has worked in tourism for more than 30 years and recalls some locals posting protest signs in their yards. “It was hit-and-miss there for a while, and to be honest with you, sometimes it still is.”\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhen New River Gorge was designated a national park in 2020, and the number of visitors nearly doubled in one year (from around 300,000 to more than half a million), it could have come with similar pushback. But according to David Bieri, the park’s supervisory ranger, it hasn’t. “All the local communities in the area are the ones that pushed for this to become a national park,” he says. “And we’re seeing a lot of local groups developing trails for hiking, rock climbing, and mountain biking in areas outside the park.”\nFamilies in former coal-mining communities are often the ones driving conservation efforts, too—even volunteering to help pick up trash during government shut-downs—because they’ve seen how important the park is for their long-term survival. National-park enthusiasts, when compared with other visitors, tend to come to the gorge from farther away, stay longer, and pump more money into local businesses. More than 1.5 million people visited New River Gorge last year, almost three times the number of visitors to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and roughly the same number as visited Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. The spike in tourism pumped almost $100 million into West Virginia’s economy.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWest of the national park, several of the state’s civic leaders and entrepreneurs have also found creative ways to work with coal, timber, and gas companies to turn unused acreage into tourism hotspots. One of the largest and most successful projects has been the 1,100-mile Hatfield-McCoy trail system, a multi-loop spiderweb for ATVs, UTVs, and other off-roading vehicles that cuts through nine counties in some of Appalachia’s most rugged wilderness—. It’s the only off-roading trail system of its size east of the Mississippi, and more than 80 percent of the 100,000-plus riders who use the trails come from other states.\nWhen Jeff Lusk, executive director of the Hatfield-McCoy Regional Authority, explains the importance of projects like the trail system, he’s careful not to present these efforts as offering one-to-one replacements for coal jobs. Rather, they create an environment in which new types of small businesses can grow, and those businesses in turn can create jobs in hotels, cabins, restaurants, gas stations, and equipment rentals.\nAll of this allows former coal towns to regain their strength. “A community has to have people, and a job translates into people,” Lusk says. “It translates into somebody filling up a vacant house, mowing the grass. And maybe you get really lucky, and they’re a young couple, and they send a kid to school, and now, really, that’s a win-win, because that lets your little school continue to exist in your community.” The effects ripple outward in all sorts of indirect ways, and that gives Lusk a lot of hope.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\n“This was our past, and it’s going to be a part of our future,” he says of the energy economy. “There’s going to be coal mining going on here for the next 100 years. But we can also dothis, and this can be adifferentthing.”\n● ● ●\nThere are many parts of working underground that Tony Basconi, another former miner who now works as a guide in Beckley, does not miss about his 40 years on the job. He doesn’t miss the toll it took on his body, which resulted in two knee replacements, a blown-out shoulder, and carpal tunnel in his fingers. He doesn’t miss getting up at 3:30 on winter mornings to drive to work for a 12-hour shift. He doesn’t miss all the time he spent away from his wife and three kids.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhat he does miss is the camaraderie. “You worked around guys that you trusted with your life,” he says. “It takes us all to make it go. I gotta watch out for you. You watch out for me.”\nThat same spirit inspired three-time Grammy winner Bill Withers’s 1972 hit song, “Lean on Me,” which came from his memories of growing up in Beckley, where his father mined coal. “My family didn’t have a refrigerator, and the people across the street from us didn’t have a phone,” Withers once told an interviewer. “So we helped each other. They gave us ice, and we let them use our phone.” This summer, Beckley will host its fourth annual Bill Withers Festival, as well as a host of other celebrations.\n“If you understand the coal history of our region as you travel,” Lisa Strader says, “everything else is going to make more sense.” But she and others in her industry are excited for this new era, in which dozens of small businesses are thriving—businesses that aren’t subject to the boom-and-bust cycle of energy extraction.\nTony Basconi has watched tourism change communities like his. “I’ve definitely seen business pick up,” he says, and he expects that trend to continue. At least one new hotel has opened to accommodate more visitors, and the Dish Cafe in downtown Beckley just cut the ribbon on a second location.\nBut despite these positive steps, Basconi never wants the work of miners like him, and generations before him, to be forgotten. He understands that coal can be a divisive issue—“I want clean air and water, too,” he says—but he still believes it’s an important part of American history. When he meets visitors, he wants to give them a tour of the mine. To tell them about a way of life that once powered America. And to answer their questions about a job most can’t imagine. More than anything, he says: “I just want them to respect it.”\n● ● ●\nFrom Coal to CoolAcross the region, former mining lands have become tourism destinations. These outdoor adventures and cultural attractions await visitors to the region.\nThe Kentucky WildlandsYou could drive (and hike, climb, raft, and off-road) for days in the Kentucky Wildlands and never feel you’ve seen it all. Spanning 14,000 heavily wooded square miles in the southeast corner of the state, these lands include former coal-related areas and businesses that have been retooled as sustainable tourism destinations. They are dotted with more than 800 waterfalls, some of which offer visitors a chance to view rare “moonbows,” or lunar rainbows, when the sun goes down. Don traditional mining gear and tour a working mine at Portal 31 near the town of Lynch, as well as the abandoned mining settlement of Blue Heron outside Stearns. If wildlife viewing is your passion, mark your calendar for the spring of 2026, when the Appalachian Wildlife Foundation will open Boone’s Ridge, a 12,000-acre nature preserve on former mine lands now populated by elk, black bear, and more than 250 species of birds.\nVirginia Coal Heritage TrailThis scenic byway meanders through more than 300 miles of southwest Virginia’s former coalfields. To get the most out of it, start by exploring a 13-foot-tall coal seam at the Pocahontas Exhibition Mine in Pocahontas, where guide Michelle Crigger will share stories from her own family’s history in mining. After, head southwest to Dante, a former coal settlement that more than 4,000 people once called home. There, you can visit the Dante Coal Mining & Railroad Museum or stroll along the nearby Clinch River. Finally, venture due west to the town of Appalachia, where many of the original buildings from this former mining hub have been left intact. Hop in a kayak and paddle down the Powell River, or bike along 2.4 miles of the former Louisville & Nashville Railroad bed.\nBridge WalkDon’t try this one if you’re scared of heights: You’ll need to clip into a safety harness to journey across the catwalk under the iconic New River Gorge Bridge, which soars almost 900 feet above the water. Tours last two to three hours.\nEndless Wall TrailIt’s one of the most well-traversed trails in New River Gorge for a reason. This 2.4-mile trek hugs the sandstone cliffs for spectacular 1,000-foot views.\nExhibition Coal Mine & Youth MuseumClimb into a “mantrip,” or personnel carrier, and travel more than 100 feet underground into this decommissioned Beckley coal mine. (All tour guides are former miners.) In the onsite museum, view historical artifacts from mining’s early days (lunch pails, fossils found in the mines), and explore the historic miners’ homes.\nHatfield-McCoy TrailsThis vast, 1,000-mile ATV trail system through former coal and timber lands (located about an hour and a half west of Beckley) will take you off-roading in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness. Make sure to secure a permit at one of the trailheads first.\nNew and Gauley River AdventuresThe New and Gauley Rivers feature some of the most heart-pounding rapids in Southern Appalachia, and this family-owned company runs trips on both that are appropriate for all ages and skill levels. While trips on the New River begin in March and run through the fall, Gauley trips are limited to the fall dam-release schedule.\nTamarack MarketplaceAn essential stop for anyone visiting the region, this sprawling Beckley gallery is the perfect place to shop for gifts while learning about West Virginia’s rich cultural history. It features works from a rotating roster of the state’s finest woodworkers, potters, glassblowers, sculptors, and graphic artists.\nTheatre West VirginiaBeginning in June, visit the Cliffside Amphitheatre in the Grandview section of New River Gorge for outdoor performances ofThe Hatfields and McCoysandHoney in the Rock, two dramas about West Virginia’s history.\nAdventures in the GorgeIf you’ve ever finished a rafting trip and wished you didn’t have to go home, this whitewater outfit has four words for you: You don’t have to. Accommodations range from old-school (campsites and glamping) to upscale (deluxe cabins), with four levels in between. There’s also a zipline, ropes course, and restaurant.\nThis article appears in the Spring 2025 issue ofSouthbound.\n",

It welcomes animals slowly and carefully and encourages observation and education rather than invasive human contact. The tour ends at the giraffe barn, where two-year-old Phoenix uses his tongue to pull leaves from a bouquet of hanging branches. Animal care staffer Marie Brackenbury extends a handful to Avery, who gleefully offers it to Phoenix. (He accepts.) Next door in the rhino barn, a trio of caretakers decorates the walls with Dr. Seuss–style drawings to celebrate World Rhino Day. One has etched the start of a line fromThe Lorax: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot . . .”. The folks around here know the rest: “ . . . nothing is going to get better.

    "body": "Illustration by Brainstorm\nSouthwest Alabama is a land dominated by water, from Mobile Bay and the Gulf of Mexico to the Magnolia River and the Mississippi Sound, as well as a host of lakes and lagoons, swamps and sloughs, bogs and bayous. As such, travelers along Alabama’s Coastal Connection, a National Scenic Byway, will be treated to plenty of stunning water views.\nThis part of Alabama is also a point of cultural confluence, where staples of traditional Southern culture (azaleas, oak trees, gumbo) combine with iconic elements of the beach scene (frozen cocktails and charter cruises). Sweet tea meets sugar-white shorelines, and pine trees—longleaf and loblolly—outstrip palms.\nExpect ecological diversity as well. A major migration route for more than 400 avian species, the area is renowned for birding, and those plentiful bodies of water foster an abundance of marine life and freshwater creatures. For visitors, that means endless opportunities for fishing—from high-adrenaline deep-sea charters to peaceful mornings on the glass-smooth lakes or slow-moving rivers—as well as outstanding seafood. And at the heart of the region sits coastal Alabama’s crown jewel, Gulf State Park, encompassing more than 6,000 acres of marshes and woodlands, spring-fed lakes and pine savannas, and coastal dunes and beaches, crisscrossed by a 28-mile paved trail system that opens the park to bikers, hikers, skaters, and runners.\n● ● ●\nFairhopeThis idyllic town on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay exudes a spirit of welcome, from its charming brick sidewalks to the hundreds of planters, baskets, and beds spilling over with flowers. Plan to spend a couple hours shopping the many downtown boutiques and shops (antiques abound), including Page & Palette, one of the South’s best independent bookstores. Stop by the Barn at the Hope Farm, a couple miles east of downtown, for a light lunch (the BLT on housemade sourdough is excellent), then head across the street to Fairhope Brewing for a pint of cold, crisp Cheap Sunglasses golden ale.\nCourtesy Jumping Rocks\nMagnolia Springs Bed & BreakfastThe setting, beneath a canopy of centuries-old oaks just a stone’s throw from the mirror-like Magnolia River, is magnificent. The inn, a late-Victorian house constructed in 1897 of local pine and showcasing original heart pine floors and curly pine trim work, is a stunner. But it’s the care longtime innkeepers David Worthington and Eric Bigelow lavish on their guests that has kept this establishment on “best” lists for almost three decades. Enjoy breakfast on the wraparound porch, kayaking excursions outfitted by local operator Mandi-Jo’s, and a lazy afternoon reading a book.\nJesse’s RestaurantSituated in the former general store that served the townspeople of tiny Magnolia Springs for decades, this restaurant prized for its dry-aged steaks has been a gathering place for locals, as well as a destination for travelers, since its 1999 opening. Indulge in favorites including baked brie with roasted apples and pecan praline sauce, crabcakes with jalapeño tartar sauce, and crawfish mac and cheese. The classic but casual atmosphere, exceptional service from a friendly, well-informed staff, and excellent bar program ensure an unforgettable evening.\nOrange Beach History MuseumSmall museums, like this one set in a restored 1910 schoolhouse in Orange Beach, are the stuff of roadtrippers’ dreams. Wandering through the assemblage of artifacts—wooden ship wheels, whaling spears, vintage rods and reels, and petrified shark teeth—feels like diving a wreck or climbing into a sea captain’s attic. Also on display are Choctaw and Creek Indian pottery, arrowheads, and pipe bowls, as well as a host of taxidermied sea creatures, from horseshoe crabs and bulldozer shrimp to sailfish and marlins.\nCourtesy Anonyme Cruises\nAnonyme CruisesCaptain DD Russo comes from a family of sailors and has worked on boats her whole life. Today, she takes passengers into the back bays of Orange Beach, where she spent childhood summers sailing and skiing, aboard her electric Duffy boat,Anonyme II. The intimate cruises for six travel quietly through the no-wake zones of Terry Cove, Perdido Pass, Cotton Bayou, and Old River, past Robinson and Bird islands, and along inlets and canals. Spot attending pods of dolphins, flocks of seabirds, and nesting ospreys, as Russo shares stories of the local waterways—amassed during a life spent navigating them.\nCourtesy Flora-Bama\nFlora-Bama LoungeSince 1964, this waterfront bar on the Florida-Alabama border has been a favorite destination for visitors looking to cut loose and get their beach on. The rambling, multilevel roadhouse, invitingly warm and weathered (like many of its longtime bartenders and regulars), is renowned for its secret-recipe version of the Bushwacker, a boozy milkshake traditionally featuring rum, coffee liqueur, and cream of coconut. Enjoy the sweet concoction with a plate of Cajun oysters as you watch the sun drop into the Gulf, then head to one of five stages for live music and dancing.\nCourtesy Gulf Shores & Orange Beach Tourism\nThe Lodge at Gulf State ParkA model of sustainability in design and hospitality, this resort was reborn in 2018 as part of a massive enhancement plan for the iconic Gulf Shores park (funded by an $85.5 million payout from BP following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill). It’s also the ideal base camp for exploring the sprawling 6,000-acre park. The lodge offers complimentary bike rentals; kayak, paddleboard, and bike tours; and an impressive slate of classes and programs at the Learning Campus, from stargazing and snake encounters to organic gardening and seashell identification.\nPhoto by Mike Buck\nLuLu’sMove over, Margaritaville. This festive, family-friendly entertainment complex in Gulf Shores, the flagship of Lucy Buffett’s coastal culinary empire, raises the bar on waterfront fun. Fill up on favorites such as shrimp and grits, gumbo (a generations-old family recipe), and the Key West Bowl, featuring blackened grouper, Cuban rice, black beans, and turnip greens. Stick around to play cornhole or vintage arcade games, sit for a caricature, and groove to great live music (as you’d expect at a joint dreamed up by Jimmy Buffett’s kid sister).\nPhoto by Seth Wickman\nBon Secour National Wildlife RefugeFrom the French for “safe harbor,” this aptly named refuge provides both a stopover for millions of migrating songbirds and protected habitats for threatened and endangered animals, including the Alabama beach mouse and a trio of sea turtle species. In addition to the birds passing through on spring migration, avian enthusiasts may encounter year-round residents, such as brown pelicans, pine warblers, ospreys, and brown-headed nuthatches. Stop by the visitor center to get a lay of the land and pick up maps of the 7,000-plus acres of shifting sand dunes and maritime forests.\nCourtesy Fort Morgan Historic Site\nFort Morgan and Fort GainesBegin your journey into the history of the fortifications that have guarded Mobile Bay since the early 19th century at Fort Morgan (on the bay’s eastern shore), where a century of military life is brought to life with reenactments. Then it’s all aboard the ferry for a 40-minute cruise across the bay to Dauphin Island and Fort Gaines. Spirited tours of the fort, amplified by cannon-firing demonstrations, include the anchor from the flagship of Union Admiral David Farragut, who famously damned the torpedoes and ordered his fleet “full speed ahead” during the Battle of Mobile Bay.\nBayou La BatreThis sleepy fishing village set along the shores of its namesake waterway—a shallow, slow-moving tidal river—is known as the Seafood Capital of Alabama. But perhaps its greatest claim to fame is as the home of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in the Oscar-winning 1994 classicForrest Gump. While the company was fictitious (and the scenes shot in South Carolina), visitors will find plenty of picture-perfect settings in the harbor and a bounty of stellar seafood. Stop in at the Lighthouse Restaurant for a basket of fried crab claws or drop by Murder Point Oysters for a bag of coveted bivalves to go.\nBellingrath Gardens & HomeWith the fortune he made as the founder of the Mobile Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Walter Bellingrath and his wife, Bessie, an avid gardener, transformed their weekend home in Theodore into a year-round residence and the surrounding property into a nationally celebrated garden, often called “the charm spot of the Deep South.” Since its opening in the 1930s, the garden has enchanted guests with its riotous displays of azaleas and camelias. Today’s visitors can also tour the English Renaissance mansion, stroll the Asian-American Garden, and explore the bayou from a winding boardwalk.\nThis article appears in the Spring 2025 issue ofSouthbound.\n",

    "body": "Photo courtesy of PS\nI am eating caviar on toast at 10 am. I am sipping champagne. I am doing these things in a private suite before my flight out of Hartsfield-Jackson. This utterly ruinous experience is courtesy ofPS ATL, the Atlanta airport’s standalone private terminal.\nPhoto courtesy of PS\nThe PS ATL experience is not inexpensive. All-access members pay a $4,850 annual fee, then $3,650 for up to four people to enjoy a private suite before their flight. Non-members pay $4,950 for the same. There are less expensive (though still pricey) options for those who opt for PS’s salon, or high-end lounge. Currently, the only PS locations outside Atlanta are in Los Angeles and Paris.\nPS costs a lot of money, but it delivers an entirely over-the-top experience. It’s located in its own standalone building, so I didn’t have to go anywhere near the main terminal. Once I arrived, I handed my luggage to a team of porters, who tagged it all and checked it onto my flight. Then, I gave my keys to the valets, who are not only keeping my car while I’m away—they’re detailing it too.\nNow I’m ensconced in my private suite, complete with a large-screen TV, sleek couches, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the airport’s runways. My private bathroom is stocked with travel-sized shampoos and toothbrushes; the mini-fridge is jammed with sparkling water, beer, wine, and cheeses. On the marble countertops, there are baskets of chips, displays of ear buds and chargers, bowls of candy. All of it for the taking. (Whydidn’t I bring an empty carry-on for this haul?)\nStill nibbling on caviar, I peruse the menu for a proper meal. Just because it sounds cool, I opt for the chicken sausage and waffles with aerated bacon cream, bacon powder, and hot maple syrup. Why the heck not?\nWhen my food arrives, I kick off my shoes, lean back into the couch, and savor bite after bite of my salty-sweet breakfast. I channel surf for a little while. I check the time.Ugh.My plane leaves soon. I pick up one of the suite’s empty “travel-snack” boxes and fill it with loot from the countertop: a bar ofAtlanta-made Xocolatl chocolate,a bag of truffle potato chips, individually wrapped chocolate-chip cookies.\nThen I hear a knock. “Ready to go through security?” PS ATL’s concierge asks.\nI’m not, but I must, and the process is so simple it makes me laugh out loud. PS ATL has its own TSA security line, and getting through it takes exactly two minutes. Snack box in hand, I exit the security area and find myself in a carport where a black BMW awaits. It’s quite an experience driving through the airfields of the world’s busiest airport, passing 757s and ground-support equipment until we reach my Delta plane.\nPhoto courtesy of PS\n“Here we are,” my driver tells me, even though it’s obvious, and I get out of the car. My plane looks massive from this vantage point. I climb a flight of stairs to the jet bridge entrance—the place right by the airplane door, where people check strollers. Then I make my way to my seat on the plane. I look out the window and see the BMW driving away. My upcoming vacation feels somewhat irrelevant; I’m pretty sure the best part of my trip just took place.\n",

    "name": "5 tips to know before you travel to Universal Orlando’s new park, Epic Universe",
    "body": "Photo courtesy of Universal\nIt’s been more than 25 years since a new theme park opened in Orlando—which, coincidentally, is about how long it’s been since I moved from Central Florida to Atlanta. A roller-coaster lover by birth (growing up, we always had Florida-resident season passes to the parks), now a travel writer by trade, I was more than a little excited to check outUniversal Epic Universebefore it opens to the public May 22.\nNow that I’m back, I’ve compiled 5 things you need to know:\nPhoto courtesy of Universal\nEpic Universe is Universal Orlando’s largest theme park, packing more than 50 experiences into 750 acres. There are five themed worlds: The Wizarding World of Harry Potter—Ministry of Magic, Super Nintendo World, How to Train Your Dragon—Isle of Berk, Celestial Park, and Dark Universe.\nThese worlds have 11 rides between them, including four roller coasters. For context,Six Flags Over Georgiahas 12 roller coasters. So, if you’re coming here for a major adrenaline fix, you’re going to leave unsatisfied.\nWhat Epic Universe does, er,epicallyis immerse you into the movies to which it pays homage. The Harry Potter world, for example, is set in 1920s Paris, in the era of theFantastic Beastsfilms. This world has just one ride—Battle at the Ministry—and its queue alone is about the most jaw-dropping thing I have ever seen. (It makes the famous queue atIslands of Adventure’s VelociCoasterseem like a snore.) Step inside the Métro-Floo in Paris, and after emerging from a puff of green smoke, find yourself in a replica of the British Ministry of Magic. The soaring atrium is covered with more than 80,000 subway tiles and showcases a restored Fountain of Magical Brethren. Winding corridors feature high-tech video walls and animatronic figures. All told, the queue is nearly a half-mile long, and every inch is designed to distract you from your not-so-magical wait. (More on that later.)\nPhoto courtesy of Universal\nIf you’re going to drive six hours or brave Hartsfield-Jackson to go to Epic Universe, you really should invest in an Express Pass. Depending on the day, it’ll cost between $130 and $330 per person, on top of the $139-$199 adult single-day ticket price. But considering the fact it significantly reduces the wait times at rides likeStardust Racers(the park’s most intense coaster);Monsters Unchained(a Frankenstein motion-simulator ride which is having a viral moment due to its next-level animatronics); andHiccup’s Wing Gliders(a super-fun coaster that, in my opinion, is not getting its due), it’s well worth it. Of the park’s 11 rides, eight are included in the Express Pass.\nOne biggie that’s not included is the aforementioned Battle at the Ministry. That, my friends, is its own animal with its own virtual queue (which is kind of a misleading title, since you still have to wait once you arrive). Much has been written about how to successfully join the virtual line and make it onto the ride (here’sone helpful blog), and since the virtual queue wasn’t in place while I was there, I won’t add my two cents. I do advise researching this before your day at the park.\nPhoto courtesy of Universal\nTo enter Super Nintendo World, step into a portal resembling the franchise’s iconic green pipe, take an escalator up a level, and find yourself in Princess Peach’s Castle overlooking Mushroom Kingdom. The place sounds like the game, with Nintendo music theme songs playing andding! ding!coming from every direction. The dings are courtesy of the many guests who purchased the park’s $42 Power-Up Bands, which activate games and effects around this world. If they win enough coins in the challenges, they’re eligible to infiltrate Bowser Jr.’s lair and take part in the Bowser Jr. Shadow Showdown. (If you don’t know what this is, you probably shouldn’t spend the money on a band.)\nPhoto courtesy of Universal\nOver in Harry Potter’s world, the big optional purchase is an interactive wand, which allows guests to communicate with animatronics and shop windows throughout the world. The first-gen wand is $65, and prices go up from there.\nPhoto courtesy of Universal\nYou don’t have to buy either of these items to enjoy the worlds (I didn’t), but it’s good to know they exist—it helps make sense of all the band-wearing, wand-toting folks running around their respective worlds.\nPhoto courtesy of Universal\nEpic Universe has more than 30 dining locations, and they’re usually themed according to the world in which they’re located. Over atCafé L’air de La Sirenein Harry Potter World, the book’s famous Butterbeer has been turned into the Bièraubeurre Crepe. More of a dessert than a breakfast item, it’s stuffed with Bavarian cream and topped with Butterbeer whipped cream, strawberries, and a drizzle of Butterbeer caramel sauce.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon World, the viral mac-and-cheese cone is probably best eaten after you’ve finished all the roller coasters you plan to ride for the day. It’s basically a cone of garlic bread stuffed with macaroni and cheese, then topped with goldfish crackers or pulled pork with peanut-bacon jam. Don’t forget your Tums.\nEpic Universe has two full-service restaurants,Atlantic(seafood and steaks) and theBlue Dragon Pan-Asian Restaurant. If you go during a busy time of year, you’ll want to make reservations ahead of time.\nReady for a drink? You’re likely only a few steps from a place you can buy one. Celestial Park alone has four walk-up bars. That’s before you enter a restaurant, most of which sell alcohol too. (Word to the wise: Don’t go too crazy; Orlando can get searingly hot, and critics are complaining that Epic Universe doesn’t have a whole lot of shade. Booze + the blazing sun aren’t a great combo.)\nPhoto courtesy of Universal\nEpic Universe is four miles/15 minutes from the original Universal Studios campus, which contains Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, and CityWalk. If you want to stay near Epic, you have 3 Universal hotel options:Universal Helios Grand Hotel,Universal Stella Nova Resort, andUniversal Terra Luna Resort. Now that I’ve been to Epic Universe, I definitely advise you stay at Helios.\nIt’s dubbed “the crown jewel of Epic Universe,” and it’s easy to see why. It’s not just near the theme park; it’s literallyinthe theme park. Hotel guests can walk through a dedicated park entrance near the lobby and find themselves smack in the middle of the action. The hotel’s rooftop bar has 360-degree views of the attractions, and park-view rooms offer a look at all the twinkling lights. When you’re ready to cool off, there’s a huge pool with underwater speakers and poolside cabanas. All of this comes at a price—roughly $400 a night—but compared with some Disney resorts (I’m looking at you, Grand Floridian), that’s a steal.\nI didnotstay at Helios, opting instead for Stella Nova. It doesn’t look like any hotel I’ve ever seen … part spaceship, part cruise ship, part cosmic lizard. Appearance aside, it was perfectly fine, with a 10-minute walking path to the park, but once I saw Helios, I instantly regretted not staying there. It absolutely would have enhanced the experience.\nSo there you have it, my five top tips for navigating Universal Epic Universe. If you’re headed there this summer, I hope you have an epic time.\n",

    "body": "Illustration by Harry Tennant\nWe pulled into the RV park at night and woke to the sound of rain. The wet morning allowed us time to linger on St. Helena Island near Beaufort, South Carolina, before heading across the bridge to our campsite at Hunting Island State Park, where my husband and our four children have returned for years. We borrowed an RV so that my mother-in-law, our children’s nana, could join us without roughing it in a tent. As much as I love swimming in the ocean, combing for sand dollars, watching pelicans drift along the coast, and eating ice cream by the lighthouse, I was glad for the rain. It slowed us down enough to explore parts of St. Helena’s history.\nMy nana, my paternal grandmother, collected hundreds of books by and about Black people. Raised by her grandmother, who had been born into slavery, Nana took my siblings and me to museums, plantations, and historical sites, even if we would have preferred more beach time. Is that a scowl on my face in a photo of me by a roadside marker or just the sun in my eyes? After her death, my father gave me many of Nana’s books. One wasFace of an Island, a collection of black-and-white photos taken by Leigh Richmond Miner in the early 1900s of African American life on St. Helena. The book, printed in 1970, offers tender, candid portraits of people whose eyes remembered slavery; some remembered Africa. The teachers, midwives, fisherman, basket makers, and builders in the photos are long gone, but some of their descendants and buildings in the photos remain.\nWe started with the ruins of the Chapel of Ease. Built in the 1740s, it was abandoned by white worshipers during the Civil War and used by a free Black congregation in the 1860s until a fire destroyed it. We stood in the mist and ran our hands over the blackened bones of its scratchy oyster shell tabby construction. While our son shimmied barefoot up slick trees, our daughters stood in empty window frames for perfectly lit photos with their nana. We walked the graves, rubbing our fingers across weather-worn names and epitaphs.\nWe stopped at the Penn Center, established as a school for newly emancipated people and the site of many of Miner’s photos. In the 1960s Martin Luther King Jr. retreated in a small cabin on a quiet corner of the campus. I picture him breathing the damp salt air, writing under oaks and Spanish moss. King returned there five times between 1964 and 1967. In 1968, after his assassination, Penn Center staff found pieces of his “I Have a Dream” speech in the cabin. The small museum held seagrass baskets, much like one I inherited from Nana, and a guide to Gullah, the West African–influenced language of the Sea Islands. I could have spent the whole day there, but the clouds grew thin— along with my children’s patience.\nTucked in Nana’s copy ofFace of an Islandis a thin paper from the now defunct Wilkops White Hall Inn on Lady’s Island in nearby Beaufort. My grandparents were wealthy in their old age and loved to stay and dine in fancy places. They were often the only Black patrons at upscale establishments like this one must have been. Nana did not share my love for camping. But she loved the salt air, and she loved history. And I felt her close that day, maybe as I asked my girls to stand for a photo by a historical marker.\nJosina Guess is a contributor to the award-winning anthologyBigger Than Bravery: Black Resilience and Reclamation in a Time of Pandemic, and she has written forAtlantamagazine,Oxford American, andBitter Southerner.

    "body": "Courtesy Jackson County\nPicture the quintessential Southern mountain town and the village of Cashiers may come to mind. First things first: It’s pronounced cash-urs, which is easy to remember once you hear any of the town’s varied origin stories, typically involving 1830s gem miners being paid in cash. This idyllic historic community, complete with a central Village Green, sits at the crossroads of NC Highway 107 and U.S. Route 64, zigzagging roads that part the surrounding Nantahala National Forest like a comb. Despite its rising profile, thanks to a bounty of pristine nature, superb shopping, and renowned lodging, Cashier’s pace remains blissfully unhurried. And by winter, the high season has waned, making it even easier to experience the many treasures peppered throughout this jewel of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\nCourtesy High Hampton Resort\nCHECK-IN ➞Originally developed in 1922,High Hampton Resortis a fixture of the Cashiers area, fulfilling guests’ summer-camp-retreat dreams for more than a century with its high-end rustic appeal.\nThe centerpiece is the inn, an Adirondack-style lodge with a wraparound porch. Stylishly preserved, the building, which achieved National Register status in 1991, revels in its history: Old guest logs line the hallways, and original antique furniture accents each room, while colorful textiles and modern amenities courtesy of a 2021 renovation balance it out. Use it as a home base for plentiful activities—nine hiking trails, tennis and pickleball courts, and an 18-hole golf course grace the 1,400-acre property.\nEVENING ➞Meander downstairs for a drink at theTavern, where you would be remiss to pass up a gratis bowl of rosemary and brown sugar–crusted nuts. Ask for recommendations on the globe-spanning wine list, and snag a fireside seat on the outdoor terrace, an ideal location for watching the sun set behind the granite face of Rock Mountain.\nCourtesy High Hampton Resort\nFor dinner, make your way to theDining Room, High Hampton’s upscale restaurant. The space is a tasteful swirl of aesthetics—peacock-teal chandeliers mingle with chestnut paneling, and modern artwork hangs near a towering stone fireplace—while floor-to-ceiling windows overlook Hampton Lake. Among the seasonally changing menu items, the guinea hen is a favorite, dressed with mulberries and fermented kohlrabi atop a bed of farro.\nMORNING ➞Strike out early to beat the steady stream of locals atBuck’s Coffee Cafe, a cozy, down-home hub offering freshly made bagels, pastries, and a slow-cooked oatmeal that steals the show. Settle into one of the well-worn armchairs, and sip an espresso drink before perusing local honey and pottery for sale.\nPhoto by Evan Ruff\nStart a scenic drive southwest of town to the trailhead atWhiteside Mountain, home to the tallest sheer cliff in the eastern United States and a nesting population of peregrine falcons. The hilly two-mile loop will lead you through dense groves of mixed hardwood trees and past hulking rock outcroppings to several overlooks, each with photo-worthy vistas of Cashiers Valley. On sunny days from mid-February to early March, you might see the “Shadow of the Bear” (exactly what it sounds like) emerge in the distance.\nPhoto by Nick Breedlove\nNext, follow Route 64 west toDry Falls, a 75-foot-tall cascade. There’s a viewing platform near the end of an easy half-mile hike, but if you don’t mind a slight misting, venture all the way down to a lichen-covered hollow that opens directly behind the roaring curtain of water. On particularly cold days, expect to see dramatic ice formations jutting from the cliff ledge.\nCourtesy Jackson County\nAFTERNOON ➞Arrive back in town hungry for lunch atCornucopia. Since 1892, the land has been the site of a general store, school, post office, and tack shop, but presently is host to the open-air A-frame eatery. Order the most popular offering, the Arabian Club, loaded with turkey and sprouts, or the smoked trout dip, made with fish sourced from nearby Sunburst Trout Farms. Finish on a sugar high: The chocolate pecan pie is a staple.\nJust down the main strip, the Village Walk is the place for shopping. Pop intoObjet d’Artgallery for a thoughtful assortment of decor and gifts, such as resin flower bowls, colorful dishware, and landscape paintings by regional artists. TheVillage Houndcarries antiques aplenty, many with an English country theme, while the back half of the store is a dog lover’s dream with antler chews, pet sweaters, and bone-shaped oriental rugs. Nearby,Brookings Anglersis an exceptional outfitter, providing guided trips for all levels of experience, make-your-own fishing lure stations, and outdoor gear to serve every off-grid fancy.Blue Line Bar, the store’s diminutive watering hole, features a small but enticing selection of rotating brews on tap.\nPhoto by Nick Breedlove\nEVENING ➞After a day of exploring, head to the laid-backSlab Town Pizza, which has options for a range of appetites. The Duke is a meat bomb piled with Italian sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and ricotta. On the lighter side,The Office–inspired Schrute Farms beet salad tossed in Champagne vinaigrette doesn’t disappoint.\nCourtesy Hotel Cashiers\nWalk next door for dessert atCrossroads Custard & Cold Brew, which carries 24 flavors of custard (and vegan-friendly Dole Whip), cinnamon rolls, and homemade cake pops. Close out the day with a nightcap atHotel Cashiers‘chic yet casual lobby bar, a rendezvous spot for wine, craft beer, and conversation-stopping seasonal cocktails (on a recent visit, the Negroni poured over house-made sorbet was a hit).\nMORNING ➞Grab a hearty breakfast at theZookeeper Bistro, a small, friendly cafe that serves fluffy pancakes, biscuits with sausage gravy, and a variety of egg dishes. Too good to share, the grilled ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich is savory and satisfying.\nOn the way out of town, pay a visit to Cashier’s sister city, Highlands, a 10-mile drive away. Sitting at an elevation of 4,118 feet, the resort community is a slice of paradise for golf lovers and window shoppers. Book a revitalizing service at theOld Edwards Inn & Spa, or tour theBascom, a visual arts center located on a former horse farm and known for its free exhibitions.\nDaytripper’s DelightAll within an hour drive, these nearby North Carolina mountain hamlets are perfect for an extra excursion\nCourtesy Dalaya Thai Cuisine\nSylvaCome for the picturesque downtown with four breweries, but stay for the surprisingly robust restaurant scene, most notablyDalaya Thai Cuisine, a 2024 James Beard finalist.\nDillsboroSeek outDogwood Crafters, a circa-1976 co-op showcasing the wares of more than 100 artisans, as well as a train depot for theGreat Smoky Mountains Railroad.\nPhoto by Nick Breedlove\nSapphireBeginners and experts alike can enjoy winter sports—snowboarding, skiing, snow tubing, and ice skating—atSki Sapphire Valley, home to the quirky Great Outhouse Races held every February.\nThis article appears in the Winter 2025 issue ofSouthbound.\n",

    "body": "Courtesy nps.gov\nHarpers Ferry National Historical Park, located on 3,682 acres of land in West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland, is a wonderland for history buffs and nature lovers. Situated at the intersection of the mighty Shenandoah and Potomac rivers, it was the site of abolitionist John Brown’s 1859 raid on the federal arsenal to initiate a revolt against slavery and where 13,000 Union troops surrendered to “Stonewall” Jackson during the Civil War. The park boasts more than 200 historic structures, 21 museums and exhibit spaces, and more than 1.1 million historical objects in its collection. Though the West Virginia town of the same name is home to fewer than 300 full-time residents, it welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Whether guests scout out the area after touring nearby battlefields or while hiking through the halfway point of the Appalachian Trail, Best says, “Almost everyone says they want to come back.”History Alive“If you’re interested in history on any level, Harpers Ferry is one of the best places. In one park you can see the course of American history, especially since American independence, touching on the Industrial Revolution, slavery, the Civil War, education, civil rights, and how all of this has affected the local environment.”\nMust-See Exhibits“The Lower Townarea—basically everything along Shenandoah Street and the first block of Potomac Street—is part of the National Park Service. Almost all the historic buildings are open with a mix of exhibits. You can see a film about the area, some of the archaeology found here, and the museum on John Brown and his raid, along with his family Bible, rifle, and part of his jail cell. Other buildings are set up as they were in the 1850s. There’s a tavern, a dry goods store, and a Civil War provost marshal’s office.”\nTop View“Go out tothe Point, the intersection of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers, with the Blue Ridge Mountains rising around you. It’s right where John Brown crossed over the river to come into Harpers Ferry. You can see the ruins of the original bridge, where the railroads first came through in the 1830s, and where fighting occurred during the Civil War. You’re also standing on top of Robert Harper’s original Ferry Landing, the town’s base. It’s the unique intersection not just of the rivers, but of so much of the town’s history.”\nCourtesy nps.org\nPostcard Perfect“Our most popular hike, for good reason, is the 4.2-mileMaryland Heights Trail. It’s at the southern end of Elk Ridge, the big mountain that looms over Harpers Ferry. It offers a classic postcard view.

    "body": "Photograph by Getty Images\nMemphis, the unofficial capital city of the Mississippi Delta, is widely renowned for two things: blues and barbecue. The two Memphis institutions are tightly connected—each a result of the Great Migration of the early 20th century. That historic exodus of millions of Black men and women from the rural South to urban centers turned the city into a crossroads of culture. Every spring, the monthlong festivalMemphis in Maycelebrates the city’s signature food and music.\nWhen rural Southerners arrived, they brought with them time-honored methods of smoking and seasoning meats from Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. In Memphis, these spicy ways to barbecue intersected with the sweeter, saucier Midwestern styles from Kansas City and St. Louis.\nYou can explore the tangy, finger-licking results at the 47th annualWorld Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest(May 14–17), a four-day team competition in Liberty Park where some of the world’s premier pitmasters serve up saucy pork ribs, shoulders, and whole hog, as well as chicken wings and other nonpork options. The cooks may be vying for their share of the $150,000 prize money, but the real winners are those of us who get to sample the finest smoked meats and sauces in the land.\nMemphis blues is an ideal accompaniment for your barbecue adventure. Like the food, the music is an amalgam of Deep South tradition (raw acoustic guitar and soulful storytelling) and the uptown styles of jazz and ragtime. The musical style not only spawned the electric blues of local scions, including B.B. King, but also turned out to be the roots of rock ’n’ roll.\nPhotograph by Getty Images\nPhotograph by Getty Images\nPhotograph courtesy of The Stax Museum of American Soul Music\nMemphis is considered the birthplace of rock. And while Beale Street Blues Festival—which once brought legendary blues, rock, and R&B acts to Memphis in May—has been put on pause, there are still many ways to celebrate the city’s musical heritage.Sun Studio(706 Union Avenue) is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places for its role in launching the recording careers of Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and, of course, Elvis Presley.\nSpeaking of the King, you can also tour Presley’s famous 1960s and 1970s time-capsule mansion,Graceland(3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard), and peruse the jeweled jumpsuits, classic cars, and green shag carpet—installed on the walls and ceiling. Memphis was also a hotbed for soul, and theStax Museum of American Soul Music(926 East McLemore Avenue) invites guests to stroll past more than 2,000 artifacts, including records, stage costumes, instruments, and vintage recording equipment.\nThese tours offer not only a firsthand glimpse of Memphis’s rich musical heritage, but also a great chance to walk off all that barbecue.\nPhotograph by The Peabody Memphis\nWhere to stayThePeabody Memphis(149 Union Avenue) is a local icon, opened in 1869 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its luxury is enough for five resident North American mallards, who waddle through the lobby twice a day to the thrill of guests.\nLive like the King inThe Guest House at Graceland(3600 Elvis Presley Boulevard), an AAA Four Diamond hotel with the design supervised by none other than Priscilla Presley.

Start with the Rendezvous Special, a plate of sausage, peppers, cheese, and pickles dusted with the signature seasoning—a can’t-miss dish.\nLooking for a break from BBQ? Didn’t think so.Cozy Corner Restaurant(735 North Parkway) is an informal local favorite that has been doling out sandwiches, meat plates, and dinners with all the trimmings since 1977.

    "body": "Photograph by Robert Rausch/The New York Times/Redux\nAs a destination, Montgomery is a journey in contrasts. The Alabama capital is both a proud epicenter of the mid-20th-century civil rights movement and a landscape curiously steeped in Confederate memory. Here, history isn’t merely preserved; it is powerfully experienced.\nThe Legacy Sites loom large in a built environment that embraces collective memory and thus helps shape who we are—and what we can become. Created by theEqual Justice Initiativeunder the leadership of Bryan Stevenson, the sites include the Legacy Museum, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, and Freedom Monument Sculpture Park, each offering a soul-stirring, self-guided exploration of history, resilience, and progress.\nThis immersive experience traverses the harrowing history of slavery, lynching, and segregation through the fight for civil rights and into the present-day scourge of mass incarceration. Unfolding at a contemplative pace, the sojourn avoids flattening the Black experience as one of only suffering: It celebrates excellence, ingenuity, and creativity in the face of policies, laws, and social norms that conspire to thwart progress. Together, these sites represent a physical and emotional reckoning with the United States’ past, illustrating how it continues to shape our future.\nPhotograph by Equal Justice Initiative ∕ Human Pictures\nPhotograph by Equal Justice Initiative ∕ Human Pictures\nTheLegacy Museum(400 North Court Street) story starts with the transatlantic slave trade. Deft use of technology underscores the torment of humans trafficked across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the New World. One heartbreaking exhibit on the domestic slave trade uses motion-activated holograms of adults and children sharing hauntingly personal stories of being sold in the Deep South.\nExhibits skillfully deploy timelines, art, video, audio, and other technologies. In gallery after gallery, the intentionality of systemic racism and the drumbeat of imposed Black racial inferiority are on display. But so are examples of African Americans’ embrace of what historian Dr. Daina Ramey Berry calls “soul value,” an inherent sense of self-worth that enslaved people possessed as a kind of spiritual resilience.\nOne particularly poignant exhibit features jars of soil collected from sites around the country where more than 4,400 Black people were lynched in acts of racial terror between 1877 and 1950. This prepares visitors for the journey to theNational Memorial for Peace and Justice(417 Caroline Street), also known as the National Lynching Memorial. The six-acre site honors those murdered for simply existing in Black bodies. More than 800 Corten steel monuments represent each county where a racial terror lynching occurred.\nPhotograph by Equal Justice Initiative ∕ Human Pictures\nPhotograph by Equal Justice Initiative ∕ Human Pictures\nA 20-minute boat ride along the Alabama River to the 17-acreFreedom Monument Sculpture Park(831 Walker Street) reveals artifacts, artworks, and stories of the enslaved.Brick House, artist Simone Leigh’s 16-foot-tall bronze bust of a Black woman, greets visitors at the entrance. Look for Nikesha Breeze’s108 Death Masks: A Communal Prayer for Peace and Justice, a large-scale ceramic tribute to millions of lives lost during enslavement, and the 43-foot-tall, 155-foot-long National Monument to Freedom.\nBe sure to visit artist Michelle Browder’s powerfulMothers of Gynecology Monument(17 Mildred Street). Towering 15 feet tall, this striking collection of metal statues is adorned with Adinkra symbols, each carrying deep cultural and spiritual significance. The monument honors Anarcha, Lucy, and Betsey—three enslaved teenagers who endured unimaginable suffering as subjects of experimental surgeries by Dr. J. Marion Sims, often lauded as the “father of gynecology.”\nIn a striking contradiction to a statue of Sims that stands at the State Capitol, this monument serves as a profound counternarrative, acknowledging the resilience, sacrifice, and unrecognized medical contributions of these teens.\nThese powerful landmarks are more than educational; they are a call to action. They invite visitors to confront the legacy of racial injustice and imagine a more equitable future.\nWhere to stayThe rooftop restaurant ofTrilogy Hotel Montgomery, Autograph Collection(116 Coosa Street) has a direct view of the Legacy Museum site across the street, which lights up at night.

The most notable trends include multipurpose boutique hotels that seek to revitalize old, historic buildings and feature high-end cuisine and sensuous lounges; restaurants that either embrace more varied cuisines or reimagine older legacies; bars that take the craft cocktail revolution to an entirely new level; and live-music venues that balance the needs of loyal middle-class locals with well-heeled tourists and conventioneers.\nBlack culture has for centuries been part of the backbone of New Orleans but increasingly is becoming more centered in the cultural economy.

    "body": "Photograph by ExploreAsheville.com\nWhen Hurricane Helene carved a path across the Southeast last September, it left what may be its deepest marks in western North Carolina. Here, tourism is king, pouring billions into the region’s economy, and Asheville’s unrealized fall season saw an estimated $584 million washed away. But today, six months removed from the devastation, Asheville and western North Carolina are welcoming visitors.\n“We’re open. The Asheville area welcomes you back,” says Vic Isley, president and CEO ofExplore Asheville. “Plan a return trip with heart and be part of the comeback.”\nFor Chris Barroso, chef-owner ofGuajiro Cuban Comfort Foodin Asheville, the September flood brought monumental change. He’d recently shuttered his food truck and opened El Patio de Guajiro in theRiver Arts District (RAD)at the Cotton Mill Studios, which his parents own. Now the new restaurant is closed, and the food truck has returned toHi-Wire Brewing’s Biltmore Villagebrewery and taproom.\nPhotograph by ExploreAsheville.com\n“The night the storm hit, I drove down to the truck at 3 a.m., hoping to salvage anything we could,” he says. “By the time I made it, water was up to my thighs.” What he found was total devastation.\nFour and a half weeks of demolition and cleanup at the Cotton Mill helped his parents and their tenants get back to normal. But only after a microgrant from Explore Asheville, a GoFundMe campaign, personal savings, and a family loan was Barroso able to get back in his food truck.\nAsheville’s gallery-filled arts epicenter was especially hard-hit by Helene’s flooding: More than 700 artists lost studio space, gallery representation, and even whole bodies of work. Jeffrey Burroughs, jewelry artist and president of the River Arts District Association, said the artists and community rallied to recover as much as possible. “The day after the storm, we had hundreds of volunteers working to clear mud, save art, and reopen the upper part of the River Arts District,” Burroughs says.\nGalleries across town made space for displaced artists, and the owners ofThe Radical, a hotel in the district, donated a downtown space for a temporary gallery. But the most remarkable part of the River Arts District rebound came two weeks after the floods.\n“We put together RADfest as a sort of soft relaunch of the district,” says Burroughs. “Seventy artists set up an outdoor gallery, and in two days more than 10,000 people came to look, buy, and support us.”\nAmy Michaelson Kelly, owner of The Radical, reported that the hotel experienced operational delays but no significant damage. The hotel’s planned restaurant and rooftop bar are temporarily on hold, but the aim is to open this spring. According to Kelly, the floods and rebound efforts “brought the community closer. We’re more tightly knit now, and the hopeful, determined, creative spirit of the community is shining strong.”\nThe culinary force behind The Radical’s forthcoming restaurant, chef Jacob Sessoms, is likewise optimistic, saying, “Spring brings newness and rebirth, and we’re looking forward to the new growth spring brings this year.” Sessoms will be part of that new growth, thanks to Cooks for Carolina, a fundraiser he helped organize in New Orleans that netted $130,000 to benefit Asheville’s restaurants.\nDowntown’s Flat Iron Hotel and its restaurant,Luminosa, were back on their feet quickly, delivering to meet what food and beverage director Sarah Charles Hereford called “the community’s desire for normalcy.” Initially, Luminosa offered counter service only, serving fine dining in takeout containers until the kitchen could operate normally.\n“We were one of the first to fully reopen,” says Hereford. “Since mid-October we’ve been blessed with the support of locals and visitors who wanted to come and support Asheville.”\nIn 2025, that’s what the city and the region need: support from visitors. Mountain lovers returning to a favorite place, first-time visitors exploring the outdoors, gourmands and artists seeking Asheville’s culinary and creative scenes . . . all have a part to play in the rebound of this incredible place, and in the writing of its next chapter.\nPhotograph by Shane Dawson\nWhere to stayThe Flat Iron Hotel(20 Battery Park Avenue) offers a chic stay thanks to the architecture and design reminiscent of the Roaring ’20s.

    "name": "Mining for new opportunities in Appalachia’s coal country",
    "body": "Photography by Gregory Miller\nWe’re more than a hundred feet under Beckley, West Virginia, when the lights go out. One minute, I’m scanning the roof bolts and support timbers above my head, and then, with athunk, there’s just . . . nothing. Nothing but the faint drip of water down the rock walls. Gerald Lucas asks me to put my hand out. I can’t see it, or him. It’s only 58 degrees—the temperature underground is constant all year—but I shiver a little. Oblivion is disorienting.\n“That’s how dark it is inside a coal mine,” Lucas says. He waits a few seconds, then thumbs the power switch back on.\nLucas is 74, with close-cropped white hair, a neatly trimmed goatee, and a voice that curls around vowels in a way you don’t hear much anymore. That he can do this at all—flip a switch—is something he never takes for granted. Back in 1972, when he first picked up a No. 4 coal shovel and entered the mines like his father before him, roughly half of America’s electricity came from coal. He worked underground for the next 45 years, often twelve hours a day, six days a week. It was one of the world’s most physically brutal, dangerous jobs. He still bears the scar on his neck from a piece of machinery that nearly strangled him. But every day brought a new sense of discovery, and eventually mining got into his blood. “Every time you take the coal out of there,” he says, “you’ve been somewhere no one’s ever been before.”\nThen the world changed, and miners like Lucas had to change with it.\nEnergy companies have increasingly shifted toward natural gas and renewable technologies (solar, wind, and hydroelectric power), while coal production in the United States has plummeted. It now accounts for less than 20 percent of American electricity. While this has been good news for the environment—coal is a major source of carbon emissions—it has also eliminated tens of thousands ofjobs. Communities across the Appalachian coalfields in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia have been forced to adapt, and many of them, like Beckley, are finding new hope in tourism.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhen Lucas dons his blue coveralls and hard hat these days, it’s as a guide for Beckley’s Exhibition Coal Mine, which last year drew roughly 55,000 visitors and made almost $1 million in revenue—a vital boost for a town where more than a quarter of its 16,600 residents live in poverty. But the transition to tourism hasn’t always been seamless or easy. When Lucas retired from his government job as a mine safety inspector six years ago, the average salary for a veteran miner approached six figures. His federal benefits weren’t enough to cover his expenses, so he had to find another job. Now he makes $10 an hour. “If you don’t work in the mining industry,” he says, shaking his head, “you don’t make any money.”\nStill, Lucas takes great pride in teaching people about the history of American mining (in 2023, he even met country star Brad Paisley, who filmed a music video underground). He ushers visitors into small carts, or “mantrips,” steers them into the mine, and shows them artifacts from years past, such as the old canary cages used by miners to detect poisonous gases and the carbide headlamps miners wore in the early 20th century. “Most people that come through here have no clue where their power comes from,” he says. “They have nocluewhat those miners went through just to provide that electricity.”\n● ● ●\nIn this part of the world, it all begins with geology.\nAlmost nothing in southern West Virginia is flat. Even in the larger towns, houses teeter on the hillsides and the roads wind through valleys wreathed in fog. It’s as if God crushed this part of America in his fist, compressing ancient swamps into jagged shale and sandstone ridges. These are among the oldest mountains on earth, and the New River, which carves through them, is the world’s second-oldest major waterway (the first is the Nile). Some of the planet’s richest seams of high-quality, bituminous coal run underneath this imposing terrain.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coal mined from the New River Gorge powered American industry. Without it, there would have been no electricity, no steel for skyscrapers, no fuel for battleships. But that came at a heavy cost to the land itself. A frenzy of mining and logging stripped this region bare starting in 1873, when the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway connected the upper and lower gorge, and coal camps and boomtowns sprang up nearly every half mile along the river.\nLooking out over the New River Gorge today from its soaring single-arch steel bridge (a half-hour northeast of Beckley), it’s hard to imagine the heart of America’s newest national park as anything other than pristine wilderness. The dramatic landscape that once made this region so appealing to extractive industries now makes it a haven for ecologists and outdoor adventure-seekers. The gorge plunges from roughly 900 feet to 1,400 feet at its deepest point, creating dozens of microclimates for diverse plant and animal species. Steep drops on the New River and its neighbor, the Gauley, also form some of the region’s most thrilling Class IV and V rapids for whitewater enthusiasts. For hikers and mountain bikers, there are a hundred-plus miles of trails cross-hatching the dense forests, and dizzying sandstone cliffs are perfect for rock-climbing and bouldering.\nPhoto by Holly Wolff\nRemnants of the park’s industrial history still exist, though, if you know where to look. Visitors can explore the old coal tipple at Nuttallburg, owned by Henry Ford, and the coke ovens in the lower gorge. The boomtown of Thurmond, once only accessible by rail, looks much the same as it did in 1910, when it boasted several hotels, department stores, and banks. (Legend has it that one poker game at Thurmond’s Dunglen Hotel lasted 14 years.)\nAs mining technology advanced in the mid 20th century, the coal companies began to move on. Starting in the late 1960s, several whitewater-rafting outfitters entered the scene. This marked the first notable shift from coal extraction to tourism infusion, and it came with growing pains. Running a viable rafting business required river guides to bus visitors to and from the river, often through fairly small, quiet communities. “There were people who didn’t like the rafting industryat all,” says Visit Southern West Virginia Director Lisa Strader, who has worked in tourism for more than 30 years and recalls some locals posting protest signs in their yards. “It was hit-and-miss there for a while, and to be honest with you, sometimes it still is.”\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhen New River Gorge was designated a national park in 2020, and the number of visitors nearly doubled in one year (from around 300,000 to more than half a million), it could have come with similar pushback. But according to David Bieri, the park’s supervisory ranger, it hasn’t. “All the local communities in the area are the ones that pushed for this to become a national park,” he says. “And we’re seeing a lot of local groups developing trails for hiking, rock climbing, and mountain biking in areas outside the park.”\nFamilies in former coal-mining communities are often the ones driving conservation efforts, too—even volunteering to help pick up trash during government shut-downs—because they’ve seen how important the park is for their long-term survival. National-park enthusiasts, when compared with other visitors, tend to come to the gorge from farther away, stay longer, and pump more money into local businesses. More than 1.5 million people visited New River Gorge last year, almost three times the number of visitors to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and roughly the same number as visited Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. The spike in tourism pumped almost $100 million into West Virginia’s economy.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWest of the national park, several of the state’s civic leaders and entrepreneurs have also found creative ways to work with coal, timber, and gas companies to turn unused acreage into tourism hotspots. One of the largest and most successful projects has been the 1,100-mile Hatfield-McCoy trail system, a multi-loop spiderweb for ATVs, UTVs, and other off-roading vehicles that cuts through nine counties in some of Appalachia’s most rugged wilderness—. It’s the only off-roading trail system of its size east of the Mississippi, and more than 80 percent of the 100,000-plus riders who use the trails come from other states.\nWhen Jeff Lusk, executive director of the Hatfield-McCoy Regional Authority, explains the importance of projects like the trail system, he’s careful not to present these efforts as offering one-to-one replacements for coal jobs. Rather, they create an environment in which new types of small businesses can grow, and those businesses in turn can create jobs in hotels, cabins, restaurants, gas stations, and equipment rentals.\nAll of this allows former coal towns to regain their strength. “A community has to have people, and a job translates into people,” Lusk says. “It translates into somebody filling up a vacant house, mowing the grass. And maybe you get really lucky, and they’re a young couple, and they send a kid to school, and now, really, that’s a win-win, because that lets your little school continue to exist in your community.” The effects ripple outward in all sorts of indirect ways, and that gives Lusk a lot of hope.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\n“This was our past, and it’s going to be a part of our future,” he says of the energy economy. “There’s going to be coal mining going on here for the next 100 years. But we can also dothis, and this can be adifferentthing.”\n● ● ●\nThere are many parts of working underground that Tony Basconi, another former miner who now works as a guide in Beckley, does not miss about his 40 years on the job. He doesn’t miss the toll it took on his body, which resulted in two knee replacements, a blown-out shoulder, and carpal tunnel in his fingers. He doesn’t miss getting up at 3:30 on winter mornings to drive to work for a 12-hour shift. He doesn’t miss all the time he spent away from his wife and three kids.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhat he does miss is the camaraderie. “You worked around guys that you trusted with your life,” he says. “It takes us all to make it go. I gotta watch out for you. You watch out for me.”\nThat same spirit inspired three-time Grammy winner Bill Withers’s 1972 hit song, “Lean on Me,” which came from his memories of growing up in Beckley, where his father mined coal. “My family didn’t have a refrigerator, and the people across the street from us didn’t have a phone,” Withers once told an interviewer. “So we helped each other. They gave us ice, and we let them use our phone.” This summer, Beckley will host its fourth annual Bill Withers Festival, as well as a host of other celebrations.\n“If you understand the coal history of our region as you travel,” Lisa Strader says, “everything else is going to make more sense.” But she and others in her industry are excited for this new era, in which dozens of small businesses are thriving—businesses that aren’t subject to the boom-and-bust cycle of energy extraction.\nTony Basconi has watched tourism change communities like his. “I’ve definitely seen business pick up,” he says, and he expects that trend to continue. At least one new hotel has opened to accommodate more visitors, and the Dish Cafe in downtown Beckley just cut the ribbon on a second location.\nBut despite these positive steps, Basconi never wants the work of miners like him, and generations before him, to be forgotten. He understands that coal can be a divisive issue—“I want clean air and water, too,” he says—but he still believes it’s an important part of American history. When he meets visitors, he wants to give them a tour of the mine. To tell them about a way of life that once powered America. And to answer their questions about a job most can’t imagine. More than anything, he says: “I just want them to respect it.”\n● ● ●\nFrom Coal to CoolAcross the region, former mining lands have become tourism destinations. These outdoor adventures and cultural attractions await visitors to the region.\nThe Kentucky WildlandsYou could drive (and hike, climb, raft, and off-road) for days in the Kentucky Wildlands and never feel you’ve seen it all. Spanning 14,000 heavily wooded square miles in the southeast corner of the state, these lands include former coal-related areas and businesses that have been retooled as sustainable tourism destinations. They are dotted with more than 800 waterfalls, some of which offer visitors a chance to view rare “moonbows,” or lunar rainbows, when the sun goes down. Don traditional mining gear and tour a working mine at Portal 31 near the town of Lynch, as well as the abandoned mining settlement of Blue Heron outside Stearns. If wildlife viewing is your passion, mark your calendar for the spring of 2026, when the Appalachian Wildlife Foundation will open Boone’s Ridge, a 12,000-acre nature preserve on former mine lands now populated by elk, black bear, and more than 250 species of birds.\nVirginia Coal Heritage TrailThis scenic byway meanders through more than 300 miles of southwest Virginia’s former coalfields. To get the most out of it, start by exploring a 13-foot-tall coal seam at the Pocahontas Exhibition Mine in Pocahontas, where guide Michelle Crigger will share stories from her own family’s history in mining. After, head southwest to Dante, a former coal settlement that more than 4,000 people once called home. There, you can visit the Dante Coal Mining & Railroad Museum or stroll along the nearby Clinch River. Finally, venture due west to the town of Appalachia, where many of the original buildings from this former mining hub have been left intact. Hop in a kayak and paddle down the Powell River, or bike along 2.4 miles of the former Louisville & Nashville Railroad bed.\nBridge WalkDon’t try this one if you’re scared of heights: You’ll need to clip into a safety harness to journey across the catwalk under the iconic New River Gorge Bridge, which soars almost 900 feet above the water. Tours last two to three hours.\nEndless Wall TrailIt’s one of the most well-traversed trails in New River Gorge for a reason. This 2.4-mile trek hugs the sandstone cliffs for spectacular 1,000-foot views.\nExhibition Coal Mine & Youth MuseumClimb into a “mantrip,” or personnel carrier, and travel more than 100 feet underground into this decommissioned Beckley coal mine. (All tour guides are former miners.) In the onsite museum, view historical artifacts from mining’s early days (lunch pails, fossils found in the mines), and explore the historic miners’ homes.\nHatfield-McCoy TrailsThis vast, 1,000-mile ATV trail system through former coal and timber lands (located about an hour and a half west of Beckley) will take you off-roading in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness. Make sure to secure a permit at one of the trailheads first.\nNew and Gauley River AdventuresThe New and Gauley Rivers feature some of the most heart-pounding rapids in Southern Appalachia, and this family-owned company runs trips on both that are appropriate for all ages and skill levels. While trips on the New River begin in March and run through the fall, Gauley trips are limited to the fall dam-release schedule.\nTamarack MarketplaceAn essential stop for anyone visiting the region, this sprawling Beckley gallery is the perfect place to shop for gifts while learning about West Virginia’s rich cultural history. It features works from a rotating roster of the state’s finest woodworkers, potters, glassblowers, sculptors, and graphic artists.\nTheatre West VirginiaBeginning in June, visit the Cliffside Amphitheatre in the Grandview section of New River Gorge for outdoor performances ofThe Hatfields and McCoysandHoney in the Rock, two dramas about West Virginia’s history.\nAdventures in the GorgeIf you’ve ever finished a rafting trip and wished you didn’t have to go home, this whitewater outfit has four words for you: You don’t have to. Accommodations range from old-school (campsites and glamping) to upscale (deluxe cabins), with four levels in between. There’s also a zipline, ropes course, and restaurant.\nThis article appears in the Spring 2025 issue ofSouthbound.\n",

Back in 1972, when he first picked up a No. 4 coal shovel and entered the mines like his father before him, roughly half of America’s electricity came from coal. He worked underground for the next 45 years, often twelve hours a day, six days a week. It was one of the world’s most physically brutal, dangerous jobs. He still bears the scar on his neck from a piece of machinery that nearly strangled him. But every day brought a new sense of discovery, and eventually mining got into his blood. “Every time you take the coal out of there,” he says, “you’ve been somewhere no one’s ever been before.”\nThen the world changed, and miners like Lucas had to change with it.\nEnergy companies have increasingly shifted toward natural gas and renewable technologies (solar, wind, and hydroelectric power), while coal production in the United States has plummeted. It now accounts for less than 20 percent of American electricity. While this has been good news for the environment—coal is a major source of carbon emissions—it has also eliminated tens of thousands ofjobs. Communities across the Appalachian coalfields in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia have been forced to adapt, and many of them, like Beckley, are finding new hope in tourism.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhen Lucas dons his blue coveralls and hard hat these days, it’s as a guide for Beckley’s Exhibition Coal Mine, which last year drew roughly 55,000 visitors and made almost $1 million in revenue—a vital boost for a town where more than a quarter of its 16,600 residents live in poverty. But the transition to tourism hasn’t always been seamless or easy. When Lucas retired from his government job as a mine safety inspector six years ago, the average salary for a veteran miner approached six figures. His federal benefits weren’t enough to cover his expenses, so he had to find another job. Now he makes $10 an hour. “If you don’t work in the mining industry,” he says, shaking his head, “you don’t make any money.”\nStill, Lucas takes great pride in teaching people about the history of American mining (in 2023, he even met country star Brad Paisley, who filmed a music video underground). He ushers visitors into small carts, or “mantrips,” steers them into the mine, and shows them artifacts from years past, such as the old canary cages used by miners to detect poisonous gases and the carbide headlamps miners wore in the early 20th century. “Most people that come through here have no clue where their power comes from,” he says. “They have nocluewhat those miners went through just to provide that electricity.”\n● ● ●\nIn this part of the world, it all begins with geology.\nAlmost nothing in southern West Virginia is flat. Even in the larger towns, houses teeter on the hillsides and the roads wind through valleys wreathed in fog. It’s as if God crushed this part of America in his fist, compressing ancient swamps into jagged shale and sandstone ridges. These are among the oldest mountains on earth, and the New River, which carves through them, is the world’s second-oldest major waterway (the first is the Nile). Some of the planet’s richest seams of high-quality, bituminous coal run underneath this imposing terrain.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coal mined from the New River Gorge powered American industry. Without it, there would have been no electricity, no steel for skyscrapers, no fuel for battleships. But that came at a heavy cost to the land itself. A frenzy of mining and logging stripped this region bare starting in 1873, when the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway connected the upper and lower gorge, and coal camps and boomtowns sprang up nearly every half mile along the river.\nLooking out over the New River Gorge today from its soaring single-arch steel bridge (a half-hour northeast of Beckley), it’s hard to imagine the heart of America’s newest national park as anything other than pristine wilderness. The dramatic landscape that once made this region so appealing to extractive industries now makes it a haven for ecologists and outdoor adventure-seekers. The gorge plunges from roughly 900 feet to 1,400 feet at its deepest point, creating dozens of microclimates for diverse plant and animal species. Steep drops on the New River and its neighbor, the Gauley, also form some of the region’s most thrilling Class IV and V rapids for whitewater enthusiasts. For hikers and mountain bikers, there are a hundred-plus miles of trails cross-hatching the dense forests, and dizzying sandstone cliffs are perfect for rock-climbing and bouldering.\nPhoto by Holly Wolff\nRemnants of the park’s industrial history still exist, though, if you know where to look. Visitors can explore the old coal tipple at Nuttallburg, owned by Henry Ford, and the coke ovens in the lower gorge. The boomtown of Thurmond, once only accessible by rail, looks much the same as it did in 1910, when it boasted several hotels, department stores, and banks. (Legend has it that one poker game at Thurmond’s Dunglen Hotel lasted 14 years.)\nAs mining technology advanced in the mid 20th century, the coal companies began to move on. Starting in the late 1960s, several whitewater-rafting outfitters entered the scene. This marked the first notable shift from coal extraction to tourism infusion, and it came with growing pains. Running a viable rafting business required river guides to bus visitors to and from the river, often through fairly small, quiet communities. “There were people who didn’t like the rafting industryat all,” says Visit Southern West Virginia Director Lisa Strader, who has worked in tourism for more than 30 years and recalls some locals posting protest signs in their yards. “It was hit-and-miss there for a while, and to be honest with you, sometimes it still is.”\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhen New River Gorge was designated a national park in 2020, and the number of visitors nearly doubled in one year (from around 300,000 to more than half a million), it could have come with similar pushback. But according to David Bieri, the park’s supervisory ranger, it hasn’t. “All the local communities in the area are the ones that pushed for this to become a national park,” he says. “And we’re seeing a lot of local groups developing trails for hiking, rock climbing, and mountain biking in areas outside the park.”\nFamilies in former coal-mining communities are often the ones driving conservation efforts, too—even volunteering to help pick up trash during government shut-downs—because they’ve seen how important the park is for their long-term survival. National-park enthusiasts, when compared with other visitors, tend to come to the gorge from farther away, stay longer, and pump more money into local businesses. More than 1.5 million people visited New River Gorge last year, almost three times the number of visitors to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and roughly the same number as visited Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. The spike in tourism pumped almost $100 million into West Virginia’s economy.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWest of the national park, several of the state’s civic leaders and entrepreneurs have also found creative ways to work with coal, timber, and gas companies to turn unused acreage into tourism hotspots. One of the largest and most successful projects has been the 1,100-mile Hatfield-McCoy trail system, a multi-loop spiderweb for ATVs, UTVs, and other off-roading vehicles that cuts through nine counties in some of Appalachia’s most rugged wilderness—. It’s the only off-roading trail system of its size east of the Mississippi, and more than 80 percent of the 100,000-plus riders who use the trails come from other states.\nWhen Jeff Lusk, executive director of the Hatfield-McCoy Regional Authority, explains the importance of projects like the trail system, he’s careful not to present these efforts as offering one-to-one replacements for coal jobs. Rather, they create an environment in which new types of small businesses can grow, and those businesses in turn can create jobs in hotels, cabins, restaurants, gas stations, and equipment rentals.\nAll of this allows former coal towns to regain their strength. “A community has to have people, and a job translates into people,” Lusk says. “It translates into somebody filling up a vacant house, mowing the grass. And maybe you get really lucky, and they’re a young couple, and they send a kid to school, and now, really, that’s a win-win, because that lets your little school continue to exist in your community.” The effects ripple outward in all sorts of indirect ways, and that gives Lusk a lot of hope.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\n“This was our past, and it’s going to be a part of our future,” he says of the energy economy. “There’s going to be coal mining going on here for the next 100 years. But we can also dothis, and this can be adifferentthing.”\n● ● ●\nThere are many parts of working underground that Tony Basconi, another former miner who now works as a guide in Beckley, does not miss about his 40 years on the job. He doesn’t miss the toll it took on his body, which resulted in two knee replacements, a blown-out shoulder, and carpal tunnel in his fingers. He doesn’t miss getting up at 3:30 on winter mornings to drive to work for a 12-hour shift. He doesn’t miss all the time he spent away from his wife and three kids.\nPhotography by Gregory Miller\nWhat he does miss is the camaraderie. “You worked around guys that you trusted with your life,” he says. “It takes us all to make it go. I gotta watch out for you. You watch out for me.”\nThat same spirit inspired three-time Grammy winner Bill Withers’s 1972 hit song, “Lean on Me,” which came from his memories of growing up in Beckley, where his father mined coal. “My family didn’t have a refrigerator, and the people across the street from us didn’t have a phone,” Withers once told an interviewer. “So we helped each other. They gave us ice, and we let them use our phone.” This summer, Beckley will host its fourth annual Bill Withers Festival, as well as a host of other celebrations.\n“If you understand the coal history of our region as you travel,” Lisa Strader says, “everything else is going to make more sense.” But she and others in her industry are excited for this new era, in which dozens of small businesses are thriving—businesses that aren’t subject to the boom-and-bust cycle of energy extraction.\nTony Basconi has watched tourism change communities like his. “I’ve definitely seen business pick up,” he says, and he expects that trend to continue. At least one new hotel has opened to accommodate more visitors, and the Dish Cafe in downtown Beckley just cut the ribbon on a second location.\nBut despite these positive steps, Basconi never wants the work of miners like him, and generations before him, to be forgotten. He understands that coal can be a divisive issue—“I want clean air and water, too,” he says—but he still believes it’s an important part of American history. When he meets visitors, he wants to give them a tour of the mine. To tell them about a way of life that once powered America. And to answer their questions about a job most can’t imagine. More than anything, he says: “I just want them to respect it.”\n● ● ●\nFrom Coal to CoolAcross the region, former mining lands have become tourism destinations. These outdoor adventures and cultural attractions await visitors to the region.\nThe Kentucky WildlandsYou could drive (and hike, climb, raft, and off-road) for days in the Kentucky Wildlands and never feel you’ve seen it all. Spanning 14,000 heavily wooded square miles in the southeast corner of the state, these lands include former coal-related areas and businesses that have been retooled as sustainable tourism destinations. They are dotted with more than 800 waterfalls, some of which offer visitors a chance to view rare “moonbows,” or lunar rainbows, when the sun goes down. Don traditional mining gear and tour a working mine at Portal 31 near the town of Lynch, as well as the abandoned mining settlement of Blue Heron outside Stearns. If wildlife viewing is your passion, mark your calendar for the spring of 2026, when the Appalachian Wildlife Foundation will open Boone’s Ridge, a 12,000-acre nature preserve on former mine lands now populated by elk, black bear, and more than 250 species of birds.\nVirginia Coal Heritage TrailThis scenic byway meanders through more than 300 miles of southwest Virginia’s former coalfields. To get the most out of it, start by exploring a 13-foot-tall coal seam at the Pocahontas Exhibition Mine in Pocahontas, where guide Michelle Crigger will share stories from her own family’s history in mining. After, head southwest to Dante, a former coal settlement that more than 4,000 people once called home. There, you can visit the Dante Coal Mining & Railroad Museum or stroll along the nearby Clinch River. Finally, venture due west to the town of Appalachia, where many of the original buildings from this former mining hub have been left intact. Hop in a kayak and paddle down the Powell River, or bike along 2.4 miles of the former Louisville & Nashville Railroad bed.\nBridge WalkDon’t try this one if you’re scared of heights: You’ll need to clip into a safety harness to journey across the catwalk under the iconic New River Gorge Bridge, which soars almost 900 feet above the water. Tours last two to three hours.\nEndless Wall TrailIt’s one of the most well-traversed trails in New River Gorge for a reason. This 2.4-mile trek hugs the sandstone cliffs for spectacular 1,000-foot views.\nExhibition Coal Mine & Youth MuseumClimb into a “mantrip,” or personnel carrier, and travel more than 100 feet underground into this decommissioned Beckley coal mine. (All tour guides are former miners.) In the onsite museum, view historical artifacts from mining’s early days (lunch pails, fossils found in the mines), and explore the historic miners’ homes.\nHatfield-McCoy TrailsThis vast, 1,000-mile ATV trail system through former coal and timber lands (located about an hour and a half west of Beckley) will take you off-roading in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness. Make sure to secure a permit at one of the trailheads first.\nNew and Gauley River AdventuresThe New and Gauley Rivers feature some of the most heart-pounding rapids in Southern Appalachia, and this family-owned company runs trips on both that are appropriate for all ages and skill levels. While trips on the New River begin in March and run through the fall, Gauley trips are limited to the fall dam-release schedule.\nTamarack MarketplaceAn essential stop for anyone visiting the region, this sprawling Beckley gallery is the perfect place to shop for gifts while learning about West Virginia’s rich cultural history. It features works from a rotating roster of the state’s finest woodworkers, potters, glassblowers, sculptors, and graphic artists.\nTheatre West VirginiaBeginning in June, visit the Cliffside Amphitheatre in the Grandview section of New River Gorge for outdoor performances ofThe Hatfields and McCoysandHoney in the Rock, two dramas about West Virginia’s history.\nAdventures in the GorgeIf you’ve ever finished a rafting trip and wished you didn’t have to go home, this whitewater outfit has four words for you: You don’t have to. Accommodations range from old-school (campsites and glamping) to upscale (deluxe cabins), with four levels in between. There’s also a zipline, ropes course, and restaurant.\nThis article appears in the Spring 2025 issue ofSouthbound.\n",

Jumpsuits aren’t common for men outside of workwear, and this one, made byWow Wow by Wunmi, brought a tailored approach with African flair. The fabric was dyed in Togo. What could be more appropriate for an ADAMA event? As soon as Wunmi showed us the fabric, my wife and I knew we had to have jumpsuits made.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nNia Umoja-KhalidAs an artist, I like to be the art and wear the art; this vintage dress was perfect for expressing my style. I have over 50 sequin vintage pieces that I have collected over the years. This dress was gifted to me over 10 years ago, when I graduated from college. It came from my mentor, who owns a vintage boutique. She reminded me to shine bright, be bold, and stay in a divine flow like the ocean. Today, I make art that is healing and embodies that connection to nature.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nIssa GrayI wore a custom suit designed by Atlanta’s ownSylvia Mollie. The fabric, a handmade indigo batik, was produced in Ghana and features the Adinkra symbol Bese Saka, which represents unity, power, and abundance. This symbol holds deep meaning for me, as it’s shared by both ADAMA and my company,Ire Aje, as our logos. While the designs differ slightly, the message is the same—and it felt powerful to show up fully aligned with that spirit.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nLisa and Kamau BobbMy “Western-Afriq” look was inspired by Afro-futurism and, of course, [Beyonce’s album] Cowboy Carter. I wanted to incorporate bold color and a contemporary African woven textile and mix it with glitzy country-western staples. My pants were handmade in Ghana from a sustainable clothing line that weaves all of their materials for minimal waste. My husband Kamau’s look was an artistic take on his minimalist “daily uniform” of black jeans, a black T-shirt, and black boots. He went big with a traditional Ghanian fugu, in an infinity wrap fastened by a truly oversized safety pin. One accessory was all he needed to turn his minimalist look into maximum style. —Lisa\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nVikki Millender-MorrowAfter a recent trip to Zanzibar curated by Jamila and Fahamu Pécou, I was inspired to wear attire that represented the regalness of our African ancestors. I paired this blue and white dress, which I previously purchased from the luxury African clothing boutiqueEtal & Co.in Phipps Plaza, with my Valentinos and a head wrap I ordered via Amazon. I wanted to embrace the theme of ADAMA’s Flowers & Seeds Gala, where attendees were encouraged to embrace Afro-opulent attire to make fashion a part of the experience.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nTre HamiltonMy style was inspired by the people of the African continent, and I wanted my look to consist of items from different parts of Africa. As my statement piece, I chose the shúkà to represent the Maasai in eastern Africa. Then I selected a tailored suit that complemented yet contrasted the shúkà’s colors. My sneakers were a Nike release called “Little Accra,” which is an amalgamation of inspiration from different facets within Ghanaian culture. I wore rings and other jewelry from Egypt, Zanzibar, and Kenya.\nPhotography by  Inari Briana\nIman LemmaThe rich cultural heritage of Ethiopia inspired my outfit. I wanted to wear something traditional from my home country, Ethiopia, but with a modern twist. The linen material is incredibly comfortable, and I loved how the blue and yellow complemented each other so well. I enjoyed accessorizing the dress.\nThis article appears in ourJune 2025 issue.\n",

    "name": "One year out, city organizers are banking on the World Cup to create a new Atlanta legacy",
    "body": "Photograph by Madeline Shapiro\nWith a view of Mercedes-Benz Stadium’s cascading walls out the window, the Atlanta World Cup Host Committee (AWCHC) spoke with Atlanta civic leaders at a news briefing on June 11 to discuss the city’s plans and preparations for the 2026 World Cup, which kicks off in one year. Atlanta will host eight games including a semi-final, expecting to draw about 300,000 fans and create what AWCHC Chief Operating Officer Georgia O’Donoghue likened to “eight Super Bowls in 39 days.”\nAtlanta, of course, is no stranger to hosting major sporting events, as the site of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and a three-time Super Bowl host. In recent years, sports organizers have chosen Mercedes-Benz Stadium as the site for 2024Copa Américagames, the 2025 College Football Playoff Championship, and the upcomingFIFA Club World Cup. William Pate, president and CEO of the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, says that the city’s experience with large sporting events will be the key to ensuring everything runs smoothly next summer.\n“The biggest advantage we have is our people,” Pate says. “Many of the folks who are going to work a World Cup have been working on big events in this city since the 2007 Men’s Final Four. So they know what to do, they’ve seen it all, they have all the contacts, and that is why people like to come here, why they like to host championships here, because they know we’re gonna execute flawlessly.”\nDespite the city’s championship-hosting pedigree, for Charles Hampton, the Atlanta Police Department’s deputy chief of the special events division, the safety logistics regarding the World Cup keep him up at night.\n“We are excited that everyone’s been talking about, ‘Atlanta has done this before,’” Hampton says. “In the security world, that leads to complacency. We are excited about the opportunity to host the world, but we know we have a huge responsibility to make sure visitors and residents remain safe.”\nJust last year in Miami, security struggled to route large crowds in intense heat before the Copa Américafinal, providing a warning for future soccer tournaments in the U.S. For his World Cup preparations, Hampton even traveled to England and Germany to get a sense of international fans’ soccer passion, observing fan marches and fervor at games.\nBoth MARTA and Mercedes-Benz Stadium will undergo changes before the tournament kicks off next year. To reduce confusion, the Georgia World Congress Center/CNN Center station is receiving a new, straight-to-the-pointname: the Sports, Entertainment, and Convention District Station. For the World Cup, Rhonda Allen, MARTA’s chief customer experiences officer, says that international transportation icons will be added in rail stations to help with language barriers and newfare gateswith updated payment systems will be installed to reduce congestion when purchasing tickets. Mercedes-Benz Stadium is also receiving a small makeover, per FIFA guidelines. The Mercedes-Benz logos on the stadium’s walls and roof will be covered up (only FIFA sponsors are allowed to advertise during the World Cup, which means corporate-branded stadiums like Mercedes-Benz Stadium have to hide their branding), and a hybrid grass field will be installed in place of the current turf.\nWith luxury and packageticketdeals expected to cost thousands of dollars, not all fans wishing to see a World Cup game in Atlanta will be able to do so. Event organizers are looking at other ways to bring games to the people of the city and visiting fans. Centennial Olympic Park will host a nearby FIFA fan festival, and the Georgia World Conference Center will oversee interactive games, live entertainment, and food for 20 days of games.\n“We are excited to bring Atlanta’s Southern charm and resilience to a dynamic fan experience,” says TJ Rogers, Georgia World Congress Center Authority national sales manager. “Unforgettable is our goal.”\nFor Metro Atlanta Chamber President and CEO Katie Kirkpatrick, hosting World Cup matches is “an opportunity to tell the business story about metro Atlanta.” There are two to three days between each game, giving traveling fans time to explore the city’s tourist attractions and local businesses. And after years of planning, city leaders hope that the tournament, like the 1996 Olympics, will be legacy-defining for Atlanta.\n“2026 will be 30 years the day that we hosted the Olympics,” Kirkpatrick says. “We’ve seen growth for 30 years. We’re only gonna go upward in the next 30.”\n",

    "name": "Fifty years after the fall of Saigon, a thriving Vietnamese community calls Atlanta home",
    "body": "Photograph by Audra Melton\nAbout 30 pairs of shoesare perched on a rack outside the door atChùa Quang Minh, Georgia’s oldest Vietnamese Buddhist temple, taken off as a gesture of respect. Devotees sit on floor cushions inside the hall for an evening meditation session. Carved golden dragons with pearls in their mouths wind around red wooden pillars at the front of the room, and offerings of fruit and flowers adorn each altar. The hall is quiet while the session is underway, but visually vibrant.\nThe meditation leader breaks the silence.\n“Visualize any pain deep in your heart as smoke,” he says. “Then take a deep breath—and release. Take a deep breath—and release. Take a deep breath—and release.”\nPeople have gathered at Chùa Quang Minh to pray, learn, and socialize since the temple opened just south of Grant Park in 1983. The congregation is more diverse today than ever before, but it has always included survivors of the war in Vietnam and their children. As they meditate, some of them are visualizing the release of the pain from that time that lingers deep in their hearts.\nLam Ngo is the president of the temple’s board. He thinks the teachings from tonight’s meditation are relevant to everyone, and that forgiveness is valuable because it brings peace to the person who forgives. At the same time, releasing the pain of the past can be particularly difficult for some who suffered the trauma of the Vietnam War.\n“Some people have lost their whole family, all their dear ones, their home, their brothers and siblings,” Ngo says. “Or imagine you spend your youth in a reeducation camp, and you work like a slave. People are not going to forget that easily.”\nThis spring marks 50 years since the fall of Saigon—an event many refugees call “the day we lost the country.” A turbulent postwar era followed, with South Vietnamese people suffering imprisonment and persecution by the Communist regime. At that time, there was hardly a Vietnamese presence in Georgia. But in the decades since, metro Atlanta’s Vietnamese population has grown immensely and now ranks as the ninth-largest Viet community in the United States.\n“We cannot change the past,” Ngo says. “But we can change the present and the future, if we understand the history.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nNorth Vietnam took control of Saigonon April 30, 1975, resulting in the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. It marked the end of a 20-year civil war that pitted Communist North Vietnam and its allies against the U.S.-backed government in South Vietnam.\nThe United States, which had been embroiled in the conflict on the ground since 1965, executed a chaotic evacuation of its soldiers from Saigon, along with thousands of South Vietnamese civilians and orphans, and third-country nationals. Additional evacuation efforts were led by the South Vietnamese.\nThe first Vietnamese evacuees to resettle in Atlanta arrived here just a few weeks later. By the autumn of 1975, there were about 400 Vietnamese refugees in the Atlanta area, and within two years, that number almost doubled. Local nonprofit organizations such asVilla Internationaland Catholic Social Services of Atlanta (nowCatholic Charities Atlanta) helped them resettle.\nIn the late 1970s and especially the 1980s, the U.S. Vietnamese population increased dramatically as refugees known as “boat people” desperately fled South Vietnam—often by whatever means possible. The journey at sea was risky, with pirates, storms, and small leaky boats, and hundreds of thousands of boat people did not survive. But those who made it to refugee camps in other regions of Southeast Asia, and then ultimately to the U.S., formed new Vietnamese enclaves in Atlanta and other cities.\nSeveral social agencies’ offices were in the Buford Highway area at that time. Plus, that area was accessible by public transit and had many low-cost housing options. The thoroughfare quickly became an anchor for Vietnamese refugees and other immigrant communities.\nTheCenter for Pan Asian Community Serviceshas served the Buford Highway area since 1980. John Nguyen, who now teaches classes at the center, was only a child when his parents put him on a boat with some other relatives, not knowing if they would ever see him again. They hoped he would find a safer, better life in the West.\nAfter more than a year in refugee camps in Malaysia and the Philippines, Nguyen arrived in Atlanta when he was 13. The International Rescue Committee helped Nguyen find his brother, who had arrived in Atlanta on his own a while earlier. As teenagers with no other relatives in town, they lived in their own apartment together near Buford Highway.\n“I wanted to go to school, but I couldn’t because of the language barrier,” Nguyen says. “So I just found odd jobs here and there and, at the same time, studied for the GED.”\nDuring Nguyen’s early days in Atlanta, there weren’t many ways to reconnect with Vietnamese culture. There was only one restaurant that served Vietnamese food, and he says it wasn’t an authentic taste of home. But as more and more refugees settled into life in Atlanta and sponsored their family members to immigrate in the 1990s, Vietnamese supermarkets, bookstores, video stores, restaurants, and services popped up along Buford Highway.\nTo Nguyen, it felt a little like Saigon.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nIn the early 2000s,Vietnamese immigrants and other Asian American communities started shifting north, from DeKalb County into Gwinnett County. The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority launched bus service to Gwinnett in 2001, improving accessibility. Plus, Gwinnett offered newer, bigger homes, and after a few decades in the U.S., many immigrants had accumulated the wealth to buy them.\nEntrepreneurship was, and still is, one of the most effective ways for immigrants to build capital when they cannot pursue the same kind of work in the U.S. that they did in their home countries.\nBoat People SOS, an international social services organization with a branch office in Norcross, has a small-business support program that helps about 50 to 100 immigrant-owned businesses every year. “[Vietnamese immigrants] normally start their business by saving up money, or they just borrow money from relatives,” says Trinh Pham, who was a refugee herself and is now the organization’s executive director in Atlanta. “But there are so many other assistance opportunities from the government that they don’t know how to access.”\nBoat People SOS helps immigrants access those financial resources for their businesses, and assists with other needs such as licenses and documents, marketing, new technology tools, and education about occupational hazards.\nNail salons, restaurants, boba (tea) shops, and snack shops are some of the most common choices for Vietnamese entrepreneurs, Pham says.\nThe organization’s office is next to a shopping plaza anchored byHong Kong Supermarket, one of the largest and oldest Vietnamese-owned businesses in the Atlanta metro area. The plaza is home to restaurants, jewelers, hair salons, medical offices, gift shops, and more. Most of them are Vietnamese-owned. Vietnamese customers from out of state—Florida, Tennessee, the Carolinas—make day trips on weekends to eat, shop, and get services here.\nTommy Nguyen and his family openedWow Banh Mi & Phoin the Hong Kong Supermarket plaza in 2022, replacing a seafood restaurant they had operated in the same spot. They are set to open a second Wow Banh Mi location this summer in Midtown.\nIn addition to working at the restaurants, Nguyen is a real-estate agent. “I’m a businessman,” he says. “I see anything we can do to make a living, and I do it.”\nThe restaurant gets all kinds of customers. Nguyen thinks non-Vietnamese Americans are drawn to Vietnamese cuisine because healthy eating has become a priority for them, and many Vietnamese dishes, with plenty of vegetables but little oil, are seen as good choices.\nNguyen has seen other Vietnamese entrepreneurs embrace the recent boom in boba tea shops, a Taiwanese export that’s become popular across the West. But he sees boba shops as a trend that could come and go. So his family’s strategy has been to open restaurants, which he thinks will be more sustainable. “If you could only afford one, will you get your food or your drink?” he says.\nAccording to 2021 census data,at least 48,000 self-identified Vietnamese people live in metro Atlanta, and more than half of them reside in Gwinnett County. Pham says this is probably a low estimate.\n“We are never happy with the number on the census, because most of themdon’t respond,” she says. “In reality, some people say we could be double or triple that number.”\nGeorgia’s Vietnamese population has been growing as immigrants relocate here from other states and newcomers still arrive directly from Vietnam. Some have waited their entire lives for a relative in the U.S. to be able to sponsor their immigration by taking temporary financial responsibility for them until they get on their feet.\nOn a Saturday morning in February, five students ranging from 36 to 59 years old are seated in a classroom at the Center for Pan Asian Community Services office, each equipped with a textbook, a notebook, and pens. For brain fuel, a tall plastic jar in the middle of the table is filled with caffeinated, coffee-flavored hard candies called Kopiko—a Southeast Asian classic.\nThe students have their green cards, and their sights are set on citizenship. They spend six hours in this classroom every Saturday to prepare for their naturalization interviews and tests. Attendance is lower today than usual because many of the regular students are busy with Lunar New Year (Tết) festivities.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nJohn Nguyen has led this class for the past nine years. He opens by drilling the students in English with questions they will be asked in their interviews. When he asks one student, “What is your race?” she stumbles over her answer, accidentally making a pun. Nguyen switches to Vietnamese to crack a joke in response, and everyone laughs.\n“I’m dying,” Nguyen says, with his hand on his forehead. “This happens every time. There’s always something funny.” He keeps the energy in the room light to help the students stay engaged with the dry and sometimes difficult material.\nNguyen has come a long way since the days when he and his brother were struggling to survive as teens in a new city and culture. He ultimately earned his GED, attended community college, and completed a bachelor’s degree in visual communications. Since then, he has worked for advertising and marketing agencies.\nIn the early 2000s, he was able to sponsor his mother, father, and remaining siblings to join him in Georgia—the first time he had seen them since he set sail on the refugee boat as a child. Now he leverages his experience and knowledge to help others who are adjusting to life in the U.S., as he and his family had to.\n“When I came over here, I didn’t have these kinds of resources,” Nguyen says. “I felt like there was a need for it. So we started the citizenship program.”\nNguyen says his students have a 98 percent success rate in achieving citizenship after his class. Some pass the test the first time; others have to try a few times. “They say, ‘I’m not gonna quit until I pass,’” he says.\nBut American politics have made their way into his classroom. A federal grant was supplying the monthly $6,700 that the organization requires to run three citizenship classes per week in different languages. That February morning was Nguyen’s last session before an executive order to freeze federal funds was issued by the White House. The class is now paused indefinitely.\n“The students were so sad when I delivered the news,” Nguyen says. He hopes to provide ad hoc support to individual students by phone until funding is restored or another funder fills the gap.\nA lot can happen in 50 years.The Vietnamese community has grown into an important part of Atlanta’s cultural patchwork, and the children of the early waves of refugees and immigrants have grown up. Now young adults, they are the ones who get to define what it means for their generations to be Vietnamese in America.\nJason Do came to the United States with his parents and brother in the early 1990s, when he was five years old, and arrived in Atlanta to join relatives who had previously resettled here.\nGrowing up, Do celebrated major Vietnamese holidays with his family, but he didn’t become seriously interested in the cultural traditions until he joined theVietnamese Student Association at Georgia State University. The association connected him with Georgia’s broader Vietnamese community, including theYoung Vietnamese Association of Georgia, a branch of the Vietnamese American Community of Georgia—a prominent social organization with a legacy going back more than 30 years.\n“The majority of those members, they were born here—maybe in the late ’90s and early 2000s,” Do says. “Their parents had to find jobs and work to provide for the family. They didn’t have time to teach the kids about Vietnamese culture and traditions. So that’s where the association comes in, to try to help.”\nAs someone who was born in Vietnam and immigrated in early childhood, Do belongs to what scholars call the “1.5 generation,” which he himself calls the “middle generation.” With the association, Do has taught young adults about Vietnamese traditions, while in his career as an insurance agent and mortgage loan officer, he supports older Vietnamese clients in the home-buying process by working with them in their preferred language.\n“We’re able to help the younger generation to know about Vietnamese culture and also help the older generation in the sense of assimilating to American culture,” he says.\nDo and his wife have two children: a son who is two and a daughter who is five. “I make them speak Vietnamese at home,” Do says, “especially to my parents, because my parents don’t know much English. They know a little bit to get by, but their preferred communication will still be Vietnamese.”\nSoon, he might enroll his daughter in a Vietnamese language class. He hopes his children will want to fully participate in Vietnamese traditions as they grow up.\n“Of course not forcing them, just introducing them to it—if they like it, then they can continue,” he says. “They live in America, but I still want them to remember their heritage and where their family came from.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nCulture-sharing is an everyday normfor Generation Z, the most diverse generation in U.S. history, born roughly between 1997 and 2012. Now on the cusp of adulthood, or already navigating the early years of it, some Vietnamese American Gen Zers are enthusiastically sharing the traditions they learned in their upbringing with the rest of the world.\nWith a backdrop of the setting sun, clanging cymbals and pounding drums resonate through the neighborhood around Chùa Quang Minh on a Sunday evening to close out the Lunar New Year week. Invigorated by the instruments, pairs of athletic dancers on the Hong Hing Lion Dance Team bring to life three lions: gold, red, and pink. A man in a smiling Buddha costume leads the lions around the temple grounds as they bow in reverence to each statue and altar, delighting the audience along the way with acrobatic moves and bits of comedy.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nLion dance originated in China, but it’s important in Vietnamese tradition too. Lion dancers often perform at weddings, festivals, grand openings, and other big events. During the Lunar New Year season, Hong Hing’s schedule is packed with back-to-back performances at temples, churches, and Asian-owned businesses around the Atlanta area, as well as at one of the two major Tết festivals.\n“I think it’s very important to understand where you come from; what your roots are,” says Kenn Ho, one of Hong Hing’s team leaders. “When I’m performing, I feel like I’m doing my best to keep the culture and the art and sport of lion dance alive.”\nHo cofounded Hong Hing in 2023 with three friends. One of them is Brian Nguyen, who says lion dance has been key for him to connect with Georgia’s Vietnamese community.\n“I’m grateful that my parents were able to give me the opportunity to do this,” Nguyen says. Then he adds, laughing a little, “If they see this—I’m sorry that I got bad grades because I did lion dancing too much.”\nHo and Nguyen have engaged with their Vietnamese heritage through lion dance, but the group is not exclusive to Vietnamese American members. The dancers, all in their teens and 20s, represent a range of ethnic and racial identities, as do the audiences that seek out their performances.\n“We’re looking to branch out and hopefully get [more] non-Asian people to join,” Ho says. “I think that would be a good way to have diversity within our team.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nVietnamese student associationsat Atlanta-area institutions are a popular way for young Vietnamese Americans to grow their understanding of Vietnamese culture and share it with others.\nVincent Huynh, a pre-dentistry student at Emory University who is from Lilburn, is copresident of theEmory Vietnamese Student Associationthis year. His father was one of the founding members of the Emory chapter in the early 1990s. “It’s kind of big shoes to fill,” Huynh says. “But we always want to do bigger and better.”\nWhen his father and a few other students were getting the club up and running, it was “just pizza parties,” Huynh says. Thirty years later, it’s a thriving, dynamic group that hosts at least two events per month, where students from all cultural backgrounds enjoy Vietnamese snacks, drinks, games, and holiday activities.\nThe club’s biggest event is Emory by Night, a springtime gala open to the entire Emory community and beyond. Inspired byParis by Night, a variety show ubiquitous in Vietnamese American homes in the ’80s and ’90s, the gala features music, dance, and sketch performances.\n“My parents used to always watchParis by Night,” says Jena Vo, an Emory accounting student from Marietta on the organization’s executive board. “It’s very nostalgic.”\nTo illustrate the diversity of culture within Vietnam, each year the Emory association chooses a different region as the gala theme. Last year’s theme was “Sounds of the River,” in reference to Miền Tây in the Mekong Delta; in 2023, “City of Lanterns,” highlighted Hội An on the coast. “I think it’s a really cool way to showcase different areas and cities that are not as commonly known,” Vo says.\nThis year’s theme was a poignant and timely ode to the heart of South Vietnam: “A Love Letter to Saigon.”\nSometimes the generations clash, says Angela Tran, a third-year nursing student and the other current copresident of the Emory association. She thinks traditional Vietnamese culture can be patriarchal, and there are certain parts she doesn’t agree with. But she respects what her parents’ generation went through after Saigon fell and how they’ve “rebuilt their lives from scratch here,” she says.\n“We’ll always remember this,” Tran says. “It’s part of who we are.”\nThis article appears in ourMay 2025 issue.\n",

    "name": "Christopher Eubanks searches for the confidence that brought him to new heights at Wimbledon",
    "body": "Photograph by Growl Bros. Grooming by Jenny Lova/Ursula Wiedmann Models\nSometimes, when his game feels off, Christopher Eubanks watches his own highlights on YouTube. Some of the videos he searches for are from the summer of 2023, when his tennis game peaked at the perfect time and place. He usually chooses his match against Stefanos Tsitsipas, the fifth best player in the world.\nOn his screen, playing on Wimbledon’s Centre Court, Eubanks is on fire. His serve clocks in at a blistering 129 mph, and he rushes the net constantly, pouncing on his opponent’s off-balanced returns. Four hours into the match, in the fifth set, instead of hitting a conservative second serve in play, he hits a 121 mph ace on the center line that freezes Tsitsipas still. Eubanks looks at his coaches in the stands, raises his eyebrows, and laughs.\nIn the clip, Eubanks is 47th in the world, but his play at Wimbledon isbeatingthe best. After another long rally, he stretches his six-foot-seven frame to place a backhand drop shot just out of Tsitsipas’s reach. Eubanks now turns to the onlookers, already on their feet, and waves his arms up and down, sending them into a frenzy.\nTo finally win the match, he smashes a forehand past Tsitsipas. Eubanks’s hands are on his head and his mouth wide open as he takes in another drowning standing ovation from the crowd. “Wimbledon was such a blur,” Eubanks says, watching the highlights. “I was hardly thinking about anything, just my opponent. I was so focused that I can’t remember a lot of it.”\nEubanks, who grew up playing on the courts of theSouth Fulton Tennis Center, announced himself at Wimbledon in 2023. His string of upset wins was impressive, but the reckless abandonment he played with, plus the shock on his face after every win, made him a crowd favorite. His run ended in the quarterfinals, the furthest an American man had gone at the tournament since 2017, and his ranking jumped to number 29 in the world, a career high.\nBut since that summer on grass, Eubanks hasn’t been back on tennis’s biggest stages. The old adage “You’re only as good as your last game” rings particularly true for professional tennis: One bad day in the office punishes players’ ranking, which determines everything from the tournaments they play to the sponsorships they get. A bad year can sink their career. In 2024, Eubanks lost in the first or second round of all four Grand Slams, including a first-round exit at Wimbledon. A year and a half later, his ranking sits at 104th in the world, forcing him to play grueling qualifying tournaments at major events to make the main draw.\nAt 28, Eubanks’s window to rediscover his Wimbledon form is narrowing. His story begins and continues in Atlanta, where he trains in search of the confidence that has made him a world-class tennis player, if only for a moment.\n● ● ●\nWhen Georgia Tech head coach Kenny Thorne showed up to a practice at the South Fulton Tennis Center, he saw a unicorn.\nAlready at a lanky six feet, seven inches, a 17-year-old Eubanks hit with Donald Young Jr., a fellow Atlantan and, at the time, an established pro on the tennis circuit. Eubanks stumbled over himself at times trying to reach Young’s returns, but he would find his feet to hit a smooth one-handed backhand. His whip of a forehand sprayed across the court, with only so-so accuracy. Thorne knew that if Eubanks could develop a reliable winning forehand and a powerful serve, he could be one of the best players in the country.\nFor Thorne and most college coaches, Eubanks came out of nowhere. He was a late bloomer, who only popped up on Georgia Tech’s radar when he nearly beat a program commit at the 2013 USTA Southern Championships a few weeks before Thorne’s visit to South Fulton. Thorne offered Eubanks a spot on Georgia Tech’s team days after he saw him hit with Young.\nPhotograph by Getty Images\nUnlike many of his college and pro peers, Eubanks is a product of the tennis centers in Atlanta’s public parks rather than those at country clubs or private tennis academies. His dad, Mark, and his older brother, Mark Jr., picked up tennis as a hobby because southwest Atlanta has so many accessible spots to play.\nEubanks’s first memories of tennis, and life, are atBurdett Tennis Centerin College Park. When he was four years old, his dad gave him a racket and a tennis ball and told him to go beat the wall. He played in his first tennis tournament at the South Fulton Tennis Center when he was eight. Eubanks lost in a close match in the final, which was enough for his dad to see his potential. “My parents were super busy, with my dad working at Delta and my mom at a bank, but our lives became tennis,” Eubanks says. “So I went to school and then played tennis for hours after.”\nAround this time, a golden age of junior tennis was happening in south Atlanta. Young (formerly the number one junior tennis player in the world), Taylor Townsend (currently the third best female doubles player in the world), and Zack Kennedy (who later rivaled Eubanks in college) all grew up in the area. (Several years later, a certain Coco Gauff also developed her game in south Atlanta.)\n“When they were eight years old, Zack and Eubanks would be the only Black players at some tournaments, so our families connected,” says Sam Kennedy, Zack’s dad and coach. “We all started to hit together, and we just latched onto one another, because that’s what it took.”\nMark Eubanks and Kennedy were self-taught in tennis, and the dads worked together to impart good form and a strong mental game to their sons. “Chris’s dad is very disciplined, and his son was the same,” Kennedy says. “Chris was a calm kid, which made him a great learner for tennis, soaking up everything like a sponge.”\nEven with a childhood dedicated to tennis, Eubanks still experienced growing pains. He was a good junior player but felt he was behind the other juniors who had better training. He played closely with Zack and other strong players but lost matches when doubt crept in. By the time Eubanks got to Westlake High School, Zack played ahead of him on the varsity tennis team. Another hurdle was his height. “He got so tall and skinny at 13, 14, that his head couldn’t tell his arms what to do fast enough,” Kennedy says.\nIn the car on the way to school in the fall of his sophomore year, Eubanks remembers his dad telling him it was time to look at tennis as all or nothing. “He decided that I would start going to South Fulton and train with Donald and the Youngs,” Eubanks says. “There was no warning but also no argument. I felt I wasn’t good enough, but the opportunity was undeniable.”\nEubanks idolized Young, whom many expected to quickly become a top pro player. His parents ran the South Fulton Tennis Center, and when Eubanks joined their tutelage in the fall of 2011, Young was preparing to play tournaments on the pro tour as a 22-year-old. Over a few months of daily lessons, Eubanks’s game improved quickly, and in May 2012, Young offered to bring Eubanks on tour with him.\nThey traveled all over the world that summer, with Eubanks as Young’s hitting partner. “Donald was like my big brother during that trip, and he constantly told me that I was good enough, which was something I really needed to hear,” says Eubanks. “Like, this was a guy who looked like me, from the same side of town, who was always telling me I could do it.”\nWhile Eubanks was in Europe, he missed a crucial summer tennis season for recruiting, when college coaches scout and extend offers to talented high schoolers. But when he returned to practice at Westlake for his junior season, he beat Zack for the first time.\n● ● ●\nAfter Eubanks received his offer to Georgia Tech, the decision for his tennis future again was made for him. “My dad told me that I was going to Georgia Tech,” Eubanks says. “Tech made the most sense with it being home, plus I could still practice with Donald. I think I would have made the same decision.”\nThat decision, ultimately, panned out well for Eubanks. After developing a serve and refining his forehand, he became one of the best players in Georgia Tech tennis history. In three years in the program, he became a two-time All-American and earned Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year twice. He excelled in singles, reaching 90 career wins, which ties him fifth all-time at Georgia Tech.\nIn 2017, he entered the main draw at the Atlanta Open and won his first two professional matches. His performance resulted in a wild card entry to the U.S. Open, where he lost in the first round. As he approached his senior year at Georgia Tech, Eubanks had proved to himself that he was ready to turn professional. This time, he made the decision himself, without consulting his family or coaches.\nGoing pro is easier said than done. Although Eubanks had traveled with Young throughout high school, he was now on his own. He spent the first four years of his career fluctuating between 150th and 230th in the world, playing many small events on tour to find his footing and trying to reach Grand Slams by qualifying. By 2021, his major achievements were a tournament win at an ATP Challenger event in Knoxville and a 2020 U.S. Open doubles quarterfinal appearance. “I always thought it was a matter of time before the results came, but they didn’t,” Eubanks says. “I wasn’t thinking about quitting per se, but I began to feel like I was losing time.”\nPhotograph by Growl Bros\nHis breakthrough came in 2022, off the court. Eubanks saw his fellow Atlantan Taylor Townsend commentating for theTennis ChannelforWomen’s Tennis Association(WTA) events that she didn’t play in. Eubanks loved to talk about tennis with other pros and thought commentating might be fun. His agent reached out to the Tennis Channel to see if there was an opportunity for him to play a similar role. His first match as an announcer was at the 2022 edition of the Knoxville ATP Challenger, the same tournament he had won the year before.\nAnnouncing felt natural for Eubanks and brought an unexpected benefit. In the booth, he couldn’t surf highlights. It forced him to watch matches start to finish, and he started to pick up on the attitudes and patterns that led to success. “Everything seemed so glaringly obvious,” Eubanks says. “I could see myself in a lot of the guys who lost close matches, so if I focused on the little things, I could beat them.”\nEubanks put together the pieces of his puzzle in 2023. In March, he reached the quarterfinals of the Miami Open and lost a close match to the world number three, Daniil Medvedev. For the first time in his career, Eubanks cracked the top 100, debuting at 85. But at the start of the summer grass season, Eubanks was upset in the first round of a small tournament called the Surbiton Challenger.\nHe texted a friend, Grand Slam champion Kim Clijsters, that “grass is the stupidest surface to play tennis on.” Eubanks was surprised that Clijsters would admit she also struggled on grass, and she told him to move on the court more, which should help him get his feet underneath him for both his body and mind.\nIt was what he needed to hear. He won his first ATP Tour title on the grass courts in Mallorca, Spain, on a Saturday, and started qualifiers for Wimbledon on Monday. After the tour win, he started to trust his game. “I was like,I can’t win Mallorca and not get to the first round,” Eubanks says. “Then, once I was in the round, I really just wanted to play on grass as much as I could. After each win, I just thought,Who’s next?”\nHis confidence was so high that you’d forget this was his Wimbledon debut. Next was Cameron Norrie, the 12th best player in the world and number one Brit, backed by his home crowd. To open the second-round match, Eubanks hit a pair of aces, then a smashing forehand winner. He played a nerveless match that dispatched Norrie in four sets. In the third round, Eubanks took care of Australian Christopher O’Connell in straight sets. You know what happened to Tsitsipas in the fourth round.\nFor the quarterfinal, Eubanks matched with Medvedev again. Eubanks felt prepared after their Miami matchup and by commentating on a few of his matches earlier that spring. After losing the first set 4–6, Eubanks’s serve became unstoppable, his play at the net impeccable. Eubanks won the second and third sets in a dominating fashion: 6–1 and 6–4. Medvedev had made only six errors up to that point, but Eubanks was still playing him off the court.\nWith the fourth set tied at 6–6, Eubanks’s serve faltered, and Medvedev evened the match. Maybe it was the heat, or maybe it was the eight matches he had played in two weeks; Eubanks looked exhausted and lost the final set 6–1.\n● ● ●\nThis winter, Eubanks hibernated at theByers Tennis Complex, an indoor facility on Georgia Tech’s campus. Other than a year living in Florida, Eubanks has always stayed in Atlanta, recently moving to an apartment on the Beltline to be closer to where he trains. He’s back in the lab, running through very specific match scenarios with his coaches to mentally prepare.\nAfter his Wimbledon run, Eubanks has struggled to replicate the same form. On the court, he earned spots on Team USA rosters for the 2024 Davis Cup and 2024 Paris Olympics, but with middling results. On the tour, Eubanks lost in the first round of many tournaments, including Wimbledon. Off the court, though, Eubanks has appeared more and more in the commentary booth. He now serves as an analyst and on-court reporter with ESPN at Grand Slams, most recently at the U.S. and Australian Opens, after he exited those tournaments.\n“He can articulate tennis better than almost anyone, and you know, it’s important he does it as a Black man,” Sam Kennedy says. Many of the junior players Kennedy coaches at South Fulton look up to Eubanks and tune in to ESPN to watch the hometown hero commentate. “But the coach in me knows that you can’t replicate Wimbledon unless you’re ‘all in’ one thing.”\nPhotograph from YouTube/The Tennis Channel\nEubanks is careful to balance commitments while recognizing that analyzing tennis unlocked something different at Wimbledon. “I really think commentating has helped me personally,” Eubanks says. “But I’m a tennis player first, and commentating should still just be an opportunity.”\nRecently, there have been signs that Eubanks is ascending again. In November 2024, he won the ATP Challenger in Knoxville, the same tournament that precipitated his success at Wimbledon. Eubanks is confident that his prior up-and-down year made him stronger, and he hopes to get back to where he was as a player, and potentially better than before.\nIn his Beltline apartment, he watches his Wimbledon matches more and more. “It’s cool to see how I served that day and my great shots, but it’s not necessarily to reminisce,” he says. “I want to do everything to get back to that level. I’m trying to remember how I felt.”\nThis article appears in ourApril 2025 issue.\n",

    "name": "Atlanta’s Forgotten Tennis Pioneer: Horace Reid",
    "body": "Photograph by Growl Bros.\nThe kid is clearly exhausted. Facing a fourth match point in the 1972 American Tennis Association (ATA) National Championships final against Arthur Carrington, a man several years his senior, the kid—Atlantan Horace Reid—can’t hide his fatigue. It’s hard to blame him: The physical toll of this four-hour match has been compounded by cramps and a torn rotator cuff.\nReid, a rising tennis star, cuts an eccentric figure: baby-faced with a short bowling ball of an Afro, mismatched socks, a cuff of rubber bands on either wrist, and a neckband stretched halfway down his torso. Barely 17, Reid looks more as if he’s late for homeroom than about to fend off another match point in a fifth-set tiebreaker. He does all he can to slow his heaving chest, to save his thick-rimmed glasses from slipping down the sweat-slicked slope of his nose.\nThe ATA is the country’s oldest African American tennis organization, and this year’s championship is the first to be televised. With a title on the line, Reid needs to win the next two points—which he precisely does. First, he drops a lob over his opponent’s head, and then, for match point, he smashes two forehands that send Carrington scrambling from end to end. “He goes for it!” Bud Collins, the legendary tennis announcer, gasps on TV, working the broadcast alongside Althea Gibson, a pioneering Black tennis champion. The commentators can barely believe what they’re seeing.\nIt was an improbable win—and one hell of a comeback—for Reid. But for those who knew him, the victory might have seemed inevitable: just the latest entry in the storybook rise of a late-to-the-game prodigy who, at 12, became the first Black player to win a Georgia State Junior Open title (in his first-ever USTA tournament, no less); was ranked top 10 in the nation by 14; and so thoroughly dominated his high school competition he felt the need to leave the state entirely.\nIt wasn’t unreasonable to imagine Reid on a rocket ship to the top of the tennis world. Many already saw him as the next great Black champion—a comparison Arthur Ashe seemed to endorse when he offered his support to Reid. But within a few years, Reid’s tennis dreams would be all but dashed: He’d quit college, fail to find consistency on the pro tour, and suffer an agonizing fallout with Ashe, his hero and would-be mentor. The rupture would not only hamstring Reid’s career, in his telling, but also burden him with a secret he felt he could never share: how everything went so wrong.\n● ● ●\nThe whole thing started innocently enough—or maybe not. It was 1964, the summer Horace Reid turned nine, and the kid wanted to steal a tennis ball. There were just so many of them scattered on the other side of a high fence that separated Washington Park’s new tennis center from the neighborhood. But before Reid could begin his career of petty larceny, he heard a loud voice calling to him. “Hey, young man!”\nThe voice belonged to Branch Curington, a tennis pro who ran the center and would emerge as perhaps the most influential figure in Atlanta’s growing Black tennis community. On this day, Curington instructed Reid to help him pick up balls, offering an ice cream cone as a reward. The next day, Reid returned. But instead of ice cream, Curington handed him a racket.\nFor Reid, who was raised by a single mother, Curington represented more than a coach. “He became a father figure to me. My whole personality is based off of him,” says Reid, who sponged the fundamentals of tennis (and life) at Washington Park.\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nThe game came almost effortlessly. When Reid won the 1967 Georgia State Junior Open, held atBitsy Grant Tennis Center, he did so as an unseeded entrant, becoming a citywide sensation. He began competing on the junior circuit and shot up the rankings, as his local celebrity morphed into national acclaim. Tennis’s chattering class anointed him “the next Arthur Ashe.”\nBilly Martin, the current UCLA men’s tennis coach, remembers Reid’s game vividly. “Biggest forehand ever,” he says. “It was just an awesome shot.” Reid had an aggressive style that could “dominate the court,” per Martin, who also served as his doubles partner. (Together they won the 16-and-under National Clay Court Doubles Championship and made it to the finals of the Junior Orange Bowl.)\nIn a city rife with racial tensions, the effect of Reid’s successes could be seen almost overnight. Suddenly, droves of White kids were showing up at Washington Park, hoping to catch whatever magic dust Curington was sprinkling, while others invited Reid to play at old-money country clubs in north Atlanta.\nFor his part, Reid didn’t reflect too deeply on the meaning of being a Black star in a traditionally White sport. Which isn’t to say he had it easy. Racism stalked his travels across the South, while some within the Black community antagonized him too. Tennis was seen not just as a White game, but also as a “sissy” sport, and he was frequently derided as “a tennis bum” and “a faggot.”\nThrough it all, Reid maintained his confidence and independence. “That’s the Branch in me,” he says. His self-determination fueled his quirky fashion choices as well as his departure from Georgia after winning multiple state titles; high school rules prohibited him from playing in national competitions. It also led him to an early exit from the Port Washington Tennis Academy on Long Island, where he went to train under Harry Hopman, the renowned Australian Davis Cup coach, alongside players like John McEnroe and Vitas Gerulaitis. There, he clashed with Hopman, who favored intense conditioning over the technical development Reid still needed.\nThe breaking point came in the summer before his senior year, when Reid, fed up with Hopman, contacted Ashe. He’d met the champ once before, as an 11-year-old, and had idolized him ever since. Now Reid hoped his hero might thumb the scales on his behalf. Ashe drove to Long Island and brought Reid to Manhattan. As they wove through the city streets, Reid explained his situation: his desire for personalized coaching; his need for sponsorship money; and his dream of attending UCLA, Ashe’s alma mater.\nWhen Ashe agreed to help, even offering use of his apartment, Reid could hardly believe it. “My feet are not even touching the ground at that point,” he recalls. “I got my hero mentoring me, sponsoring me . . . I got it made. There’s nothing that’s not going to be available to me.”\nReid remembers thinking,How can I not succeed?\n● ● ●\nThere were early signs that Reid’s relationship with Ashe wasn’t all it had seemed—or all he’d built it up to be in his mind.\nFor starters, before his first tournament under Ashe’s patronage, Reid got stuck holding the bill after his luggage got lost in transit, despite Ashe’s promise to pay. “He said, ‘Don’t worry. Just keep the receipts,’” says Reid. But the reimbursement never came, and Reid was too timid to ask for the cash. There was also a lengthy letter Reid received that concluded with a list of eight reasons Ashe had decided to help. Reid found the list “strange” on its face, “but the thing that stood out was the eighth reason: because I was Black,” he says. “You’re telling me, in this era, me being Black is thelastreason—theleastimportant reason—for you to help me? I found that really weird.”\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nStill, when Reid arrived at UCLA—where Ashe made good on his word to get him in and even paid for part of his scholarship—things were looking up. On the court, Reid played singles and doubles for one of the country’s top teams. Off the court, he hobnobbed with Hollywood royalty, teaching tennis to A-listers like Gene Hackman and eating Thanksgiving dinner with Marlon Brando.So you can imagine Reid’s surprise when, in a phone call before his sophomore year, Ashe suggested he transfer to a Division II school.\nReid wasn’t just blindsided; he felt betrayed. “It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Reid, who suspects Ashe was acting as a proxy for UCLA’s coach, Glenn Bassett, who he believes wanted his roster spot. “This was strictly him doing his buddy a favor, which hurt.” Questioning whether Ashe had his best interests at heart, Reid refused to transfer. “And, boy, he was not expecting me to say that, and things just went totally south.”\nOstensibly, their arrangement remained unchanged, but Reid sensed a newfound coldness from Ashe, who’d always been standoffish. Previously, sponsorship checks would arrive from around the world with regularity—if not with words of encouragement. Now, the mail stopped coming. Reid was forced to borrow money; he says Ashe promised he’d pay him back but never did. “It was so embarrassing,” says Reid. “He would say something and then wouldn’t do it. He was basically sending me a message. Like, ‘Hey, I’m done with you.’ But why wouldn’t he just say that to my face?”\nThe uncertainty took a toll. “I got so depressed that I stopped going to class,” he says. “He made me feel like I was a bad guy.” When J.D. McGhee, one of Reid’s earliest supporters, died in the summer of 1975, Reid flew home for the funeral—and never returned. “I just dropped out of school,” he says. “I didn’t know what I was going to do.”\n● ● ●\nIn hindsight, Reid concedes he should have transferred to another program. “I still had eligibility,” he says. “I could have gone to any top 10 school.” Instead, reeling from his split with Ashe, he ditched the idea of further collegiate development and set out on the pro tour. It proved an uneven effort.\nDespite his natural talent and flashes of brilliance, including a notable doubles run at the 1979 U.S. Open, Reid struggled to find his footing, peaking at 272 in the ATP singles rankings and 227 in doubles. His game could have used more seasoning, but Reid’s years on the circuit were also plagued by unreliable funding, leading to frequent stretches of inactivity.\nThe narrative of Reid’s career shifted from that of a can’t-miss wunderkind to a once-promising player who’d hit his ceiling. For Reid, this was a lonely time, not least because he felt he couldn’t tell his side of the story. “That’s what killed me,” he says. “I had to bite my lip. I couldn’t say anything, because whose word are you going to take? This guy is a tennis god. I’m a nobody.”\nIn 1982, by which time Reid had effectively given up, a reporter from theAtlanta Constitutionconvinced the then 27-year-old to go on record about his break with Ashe. The resulting article painted an unflattering picture of Reid as a player who just wasn’t good enough. Both Ashe and Bassett claimed Reid couldn’t hack it on a UCLA team that featured players like future champion Brian Teacher and Reid’s old pal Billy Martin. (Martin, who appreciates the difficult roster decisions every coach must make, nonetheless takes exception to this suggestion. He says, “He did make it there! He was on the team, and his level was very high.”) Worst of all was a line from Ashe denying he’d ever agreed to mentor Reid. Said Ashe, “I’ve never had what you might call a protege. I’ve never taken someone in.”\nReading that, Reid felt gaslit. “It still burns,” he says. “And it just pisses me off even more that the guy would sit there and bald-faced lie that he never took on that responsibility.Never had a protege?What do you call spending your money on me? What do you call offering me your apartment?”\nWhatever transpired between the two athletes, there’s no question that Reid’s fractured relationship with Ashe paled in comparison to what he felt had been promised—and that disconnect has come to define, in Reid’s mind, the collapse of his athletic career over the many decades since.\n● ● ●\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nToday, Horace Reid works as the tennis director for a community organization in Camilla, about three hours south of Atlanta, where he often feels forgotten. The kids to whom he gives lessons know little about his backstory. It’s true: His name doesn’t ring out across the state as it once did. But according to Richard Howell, who chairs the selection committee for the Georgia Tennis Hall of Fame, nothing should take away from Reid’s legacy.\n“Most young kids don’t even know who Wilt Chamberlain is,” says Howell, whose family helped Reid enter that first USTA tournament in 1967. “Horace has an important place in tennis for what he was able to achieve. He really was a pioneer, and he’s considered one of the legends of Bitsy Grant.”\nIn 1997, Reid was inducted into the Georgia Tennis Hall of Fame. But even that honor couldn’t close the book on his past. There had been a point, in the early ’90s, when Reid, desperate for closure, resolved to confront Ashe. But he never got the chance. “I remember I was in my car driving,” he says, “and on the news comes, ‘Arthur Ashe has died.’” Reid was stunned, and angry. He debated going to the funeral but couldn’t bring himself to do it. “I couldn’t sit there and mourn this guy when I hated him,” he says. “I literally hated him.”\nNow 69, Reid believes there may still be a way to find peace: by taking a kid under his wing, just as Branch Curington did for him. It almost makes too much sense as a final chapter—to become the next Curington, the anti-Ashe—assuming he can locate such a youngster. “I haven’t found [that] one kid that wants to eat, sleep, and drink tennis like I did,” says Reid. “That’s literally all I want to do. Find a kid that wants to be great, and give them all the help that I got.”\nAnd all the help he never did.\nThis article appears in ourApril 2025 issue.\n",

Both positions may not be able to be addressed, but a lot can change.\nFormer baseball general managerJim Bowden predicted they could fill both of those holes in this recent mock trade for The Athletic.\n\"The Phillies' two biggest needs are closer and center field, and this scenario would hit both in one swap, even though it would come at a significant price,\" wrote Bowden.\nHere is the full trade:\nPhillies fans can be heard screaming across the country for the organization not to trade Abel. He's done well so far in his time in the big leagues, and teams can never have too much pitching. (Just ask the Dodgers.) However, Bowden still believes it's a deal worth pursuing for both teams.\n\"The Orioles would address their key need, young controllable starting pitching, in acquiring Abel, a 23-year-old who has a chance to become an ace if he continues to develop and his command and control improve. ... It would be tough for the Phillies to lose Abel, their first-round pick in 2020, but with a strong rotation and top prospect Andrew Painter, a future ace, on track to debut this summer, they might be willing to do this deal if they think Bautista and Mullins are the final pieces needed to win the World Series,\" wrote Bowden.\nBautista would give the Phillies a long-term answer at closer while they could look to extend Mullins beyond this year. Abel would be a steep price, but Dombrowski knows better than anyone that coughing up a big piece like Abel is necessary to bolster the roster.\nMore MLB:With Rafael Devers Gone, Could Triston Casas Trade Be Next for Red Sox?\n",

    "body": "This week, the New York Giants have fired up minicamp and won't have one of their most notable stars sharing the field with the new quarterback, Russell Wilson.\nThroughout the offseason, the star wide receiver Malik Nabers has been dealing with a toe injury.\nWhen the Giants fired up OTAs, Nabers was noticeably absent from the group on the field, as New York wideouts caught passes from the multi-time Pro Bowler for the first time.\nWhen the Giants were winding down last week's practice sessions, the head coach, Brian Daboll, made it known that Nabers' situation wasn't too concerning. Since it's still early in the offseason, the Giants didn't see a need to have Nabers out there right away.\n\"He'll be doing similar things that he's done the last couple times he's been out,\"Daboll told reporters last week. \"He did a little bit of walkthrough here, but he's progressing. He'll be OK.\"\nThe door wasn't exactly closed for Nabers to participate in minicamp this week, but the Giants didn't have their second-year star in the mix once again. Daboll had to assure the public that everything remains solid on the injury front regarding Nabers and others who are sitting out currently.\n\"Yeah, I'd say with all the injuries, the guys are working hard to get back,\"Daboll told reporterson Tuesday ahead of minicamp. \"No, not long term.\"\nLast season, the Giants brought on Nabers as their sixth-overall pick out of LSU. He joined the team under the belief that Daniel Jones was set to be his long-term quarterback. Just 10 games in, the Giants cut the cord with Jones, as they benched him and eventually released him.\nAs the 2024NFLseason played out, Nabers was in a position where he had to thrive without stability under center. Fortunately for the then-rookie, he still managed to hit his stride in theNFL. Nabers saw the field for 15 games. He was targeted 170 times and caught 109 passes for over 1,200 yards.\nNabers scored seven touchdowns while averaging 80 yards per game. He earned his first Pro Bowl nod of his career, living up to the hype of being a top 10 selection in 2024.\nRead More:NY Giants Coach Endorsed Strong Russell Wilson Trait\nThe Giants look forward to seeing Nabers in action with Russell Wilson in the mix. While Wilson has dealt with his fair share of struggles with the Denver Broncos and the Pittsburgh Steelers over the past few seasons, he's been welcomed with open arms in New York.\nOutside of Nabers, Giants receivers have been gushing over what Wilson has brought to the table in the spring practice sessions. Sometime soon, Nabers will get a chance to catch on. For the time being, the Giants are cautious with the health of their 21-year-old superstar wideout.\nFor more New York Giants and NFL news, head over toNewsweek Sports.\n",

A significant reason for this is the defense, which lacks a strong secondary.\nMore news:Jets to Sign UFL Standout After Ridiculous 2025 Season\nThe Ravens were the second-worst team in terms of allowed passing yards per game in 2024, with an average of 244.1 yards allowed. Though the team has Kyle Hamilton at the safety position and Marlon Humphrey at the corner position, more is needed.\nHaving a strong defense would be the most significant way the Ravens could get over the hump on not making the Super Bowl, especially against tough passing teams like the Chiefs and Bills. That said, Baltimore star Lamar Jackson is already campaigning for the team to make a significant update with a Pro Bowler.\n#RavensQB Lamar Jackson on former college teammate Jaire Alexander, who was just released by the#Packers: “Go get him, Eric!”He added that he’s already reached out to Jaire.pic.twitter.com/Nv4MDJcJh5\nJackson was speaking to the media when he stated that Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta should make a big play to sign recently released corner, Jaire Alexander.\nAlexander was surprisingly released by the Green Bay Packers, leading to him being able to sign with whatever team he wishes. Jackson has plenty of history with the corner, as they both played for Louisville.\nMore news:Tyreek Hill Takes Massive Shot at Noah Lyles After Backing Out of Race\nThe biggest issue with Alexander has been his durability. The star corner is one of the best when he is on the field. However, he has not played a full season since 2022.\nAlexander has played seven games in each of the last two seasons, and his injury concerns might be a big reason why teams have not yet signed him. Although he has an injury history, he remains one of the best coverage corners in the game.\nAlexander is likely to sign with a team before training camp starts, or he won't have to wait long. That team could be the Ravens, especially if Jackson has anything to do with it.\nPer the post above fromNFLinsider Ari Meirov, it also indicates that Jackson has already been in contact with Alexander over joining the Ravens.

In fact, this run is one of the most important in recent times, since the team has officially moved on from the former franchise passer, Daniel Jones.\nThe Giants drafted Jaxson Dart out of Ole Miss to be the face of the future. For the time being, the Giants are going to keep Dart on ice while shifting the culture behind the seasoned veteran, Russell Wilson, who's got the trust of New York's head coach Brian Daboll.\n\"I think it's important to listen to the quarterbacks. They're the ones that are touching the ball on every play,\"Daboll told reporters recently, according to Giants.com. \"Certainly, he has a lot of accolades behind his playing career and experience. It's been good.\"\nIt's not just Wilson who is taking command of the Giants' quarterback room. While Wilson is expected to be the starter and could maintain that role throughout the entire season, Daboll and the Giants are still relying on the veterans Jameis Winston and Tommy DeVito to have a strong behind-the-scenes impact as well.\nDaboll is encouraged by the outcome of the new system put in place by Wilson.\n\"When you're in that room and you're talking to those guys, they see things from a wide scope perspective and bring things up and there's a lot of good communication,\" Daboll finished. \"I think it's important to really talk and communicate and listen to any of the quarterbacks, but Russ has been good for us, I'd say, in a number of ways since he's been out here.\"\nThe narrative surrounding Wilson in recent years hasn't been favorable. For most of his career, which was spent with the Seattle Seahawks, who drafted Wilson in the third round of the 2012NFLDraft, he was viewed as one of the top franchise quarterbacks in the league. Wilson won on the field and led with praised professionalism on a daily basis.\nSince his move to the Denver Broncos and, eventually, the Pittsburgh Steelers, the narrative has shifted. Over the past three years, Wilson has just one stretch of a winning record. He went 6-5 with the Pittsburgh Steelers last year.\nThe Giants' organization struggled to overcome the downfall of Daniel Jones last year. They missed the playoffs for the second season in a row. The expectations are down for both parties heading into the 2025 campaign, yet Daboll and his coaching staff remain quite optimistic about what kind of turnaround Wilson can put in place.\nIt starts in the spring, and so far, all is well.\n",

Even more impressive is that he notched 20-for-21 field goals with the Stallions during the 2025 season.\nMevis will have a shot at making the 53-man roster, and will likely battle it out with the current Jets kicker, Anders Carlson. Carlson appeared in five games for New York during the 2025 season, going 8-for-10 on field goal attempts.\nCarlson also secured 9-for-11 extra point attempts, and was 2-for-2 on kicking attempts 20-29 yards, 2-for-2 on 30-39 yards, 3-for-5 on 40-49 yards, and 1-for-1 on 50+ yard attempts.\nThe Jets also have rookie Cade Davis on the roster. It is believed that Carlson and Mevis will be battling it out for the starting position, while Davis will potentially stay on as the backup and possibly as a practice squad option.\nSpecial teams are an important part of any balanced team.

There has already been much movement, and the offseason has not yet begun.\nTheNBAFinals are still underway, and while that is the case, it appears that everyone is looking forward to this much-anticipated offseason. At the forefront of it will be the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers have plenty to address this offseason, but shoring up the center spot tops the list. The lack of consistency and production from that position was one of the major flaws that hurt them during their playoff run.\nExpect Los Angeles to be aggressive in its search for a reliable big. According to ClutchPoints' Lakers insider Anthony Irwin, the team has already expressed interest in several centers as they gear up for what's expected to be a busy summer.\n\"Sources close to the team reiterated that the internal plan is to trade for their starting center – sources say they've held conversations with other teams about Nic Claxton, Robert Williams, Walker Kessler and others – then, ideally, use the taxpayer midlevel on his backup – Brook Lopez and Clint Capela are the two names most often linked to the Lakers. It's a solid plan that they're considered likely to be able to execute. But, because of their clear and desperate need at the position, such an approach is going to be a lot more complicated than it would've been had they not neglected the position the past couple of seasons,\" wrote Irwin.\nArguably, the most intriguing name on the Lakers' radar is Utah Jazz big man Walker Kessler. At just 23 years old, Kessler has the makings of a long-term anchor in the middle and would be an ideal complement next to Luka Doncic moving forward.\nHe's young, highly skilled, and still developing — which makes him all the more valuable. The Jazz may listen to offers this offseason, but there's a sense they could be hesitant to deal him, especially to a Western Conference rival like the Lakers. That said, don't expect L.A. to back down from making a strong push.\nThe others on the list would be of massive help and a huge upgrade. Nic Claxton is another player who fits the mold of succeeding next to Doncic, as he is a rim runner and extremely athletic.\nRobert Williams also fits that mold and is arguably the best defender and shot blocker from this current crop of big men.\nAs for Clint Capela and Brook Lopez, they may be on the older side, but they will certainly be an upgrade compared to what the Lakers had in the second half of the season.\nMore NBA news:LeBron James Reveals Plan for 2028 LA Olympics\nBucks' Doc Rivers Offers Major Update on Giannis Antetokounmpo Trade Rumors\nFor more on Los Angeles Lakers and generalNBAnews, head on over toNewsweek Sports.\n",

There's no denying he's much closer to the finish line than the starting point. Barring any surprises, he'll soon be entering what would be his 23rdNBAseason.\nJames' time in basketball is winding down, and with that comes a ton of speculation on when he will call his career quits. Many suspect that this upcoming season could be the final season of his career, and if it is, it will be quite the ride.\nThe four-time champion has not only had success in theNBAbut also in the international game. James has appeared in four Olympic Games and has come away with three gold medals, including one last year in the Paris Games.\nHisNBAfuture is not only in question, but his Olympic future is also in doubt. James will be 43 years old by the time the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games come around, and the odds of James playing are zero.\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, James dismissed the idea of playing in the 2028 Games.\n\"Nothing has changed. Where we at, man, 2025 right now?\" LeBronsaid. \"Nah, nothing has changed. I mean, if I had to look at it right now through a microscope, I would say that, me being able to support Team USA for the rest of my life — that's for sure. But me actually going on and playing, I don't see it happening. I've given everything that I have, and I will always be appreciative and loyal and dedicated to Team USA and USA Basketball.\"\nLast year likely marked the end of LeBron James's storied international career—and what a run it was.\nJames is one of just three American men to compete in at least threeOlympics, joining Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant. That same trio also stands alone as the only U.S. players to win three Olympic gold medals.\nAcross 79 appearances for Team USA, James tallied 1,137 points (14.4 per game), 342 rebounds (4.3), 308 assists (3.9), and 122 steals (1.5), cementing his legacy as one of the greatest to ever wear the red, white, and blue.\nIn the Olympics last year, James won tournament MVP and was a part of the Olympic All-Star Five at the ripe age of 39.\nMore NBA news:Bucks' Doc Rivers Offers Major Update on Giannis Antetokounmpo Trade Rumors\nFor more on LeBron James and generalNBAnews, head on over toNewsweek Sports.\n",

Antetokounmpo is and will continue to be at the forefront of theNBAoffseason, as his future in Milwaukee is in doubt, at least according to multiple insiders.\nESPN's Shams Charania reported over a month ago that Antetokounmpo is 'open-minded' to trade. Since then, things have yet to materialize, but in the meantime, the two-time MVP has been vocal on wanting to stay in Milwaukee.\nBucks head coach Doc Rivers addressed the rumors on Antetokounmpo wanting out, saying he doesn't know where those reports are coming from.\nRivers appeared on the Bill Simmons podcast and addressed the Antetokounmpo trade rumors and his future with the team.\n“You don’t like it when you hear it because you know it’s not true”#BucksHC Doc Rivers weighs in on Giannis rumors.@BillSimmonspic.twitter.com/4t2SXlyxPg\n\"It's so ridiculous and you know it's not true... I don't know how many times Giannis has to say I want to win a title with the Bucks... this is the best time to win a title in theNBA, there's no dominant team,\" said Rivers.\nBack in mid-May, Charania reported that Antetokounmpo was \"open-minded\" about a potential trade from the Bucks. Since then, however, any real momentum on that front has quieted. Instead, Antetokounmpo has remained highly active on social media, showing no indication that his commitment to the Bucks has wavered.\nStill, the two-time MVP has made it clear that competing for championships is his top priority. Milwaukee hasn't returned to theNBAFinals since their 2021 title run and hasn't made it past the second round since. They've now suffered first-round exits in each of the past three seasons.\nThe Bucks are short on both cap flexibility and tradable assets, which complicates any path to meaningful improvement. But for now, Antetokounmpo appears to be standing by the only franchise he's ever known. With the offseason heating up, though, things could change quickly.\nWhile that is the case, it appears that Antetokounmpo doesn't want to go anywhere. As for Rivers, he is on a four-year deal worth $40 million that extends through the 2026-27 season.\nRivers was hired in January 2024, following the team's firing of Adrian Griffin after less than half a season.\nThe Greek Freak remains under contract for at least the next three seasons, with a player option for the 2027-28 campaign, which would mark his age-33 season.\nMore Bucks news:Bucks Preparing Last Ditch Effort to Keep Giannis Antetokounmpo: Report\nFor more on the Bucks and generalNBAnews, head on over toNewsweek Sports.\n",

By a number of metrics, it stands as one of the most disappointing individual performances the Finals has ever seen.\nWith Game 5 in the books, the focus now shifts to Game 6; however, the Pacers could play in their final game of the season without their All-NBA guard. The Pacers will be in front of their ruckus and devoted crowd, but this game will look a lot different if Haliburton can't give it a go.\nHalibruiton insisted on playing through the injury in Game 5, despite dealing with a sore right calf. He went to the locker room early in the game before returning in the second quarter with his calf wrapped.\n\"It's the Finals,\" Haliburton said after Game 5. \"I've worked my whole life to be here and I want to be out there to compete, help my teammates any way I can.\n\"I was not great tonight by any means, but it's not really a thought of mine to not play here.

In that period, Ramirez was perhaps the most fearsome right-handed hitter ever to wear the Red Sox uniform.\nHe was also one of the most controversial and polarizing players the Red Sox ever had. So he spoke from experience when, speaking toMLBinsider journalist Hector Gomez on Monday, heexpressed sympathy fornow-traded slugger Rafael Devers — and tore into the Red Sox front office for what he said was the team's poor handling of Devers.\nDevers in 2023 signed a 10-year, $313.5 million contract extension that was intended to keep him in Boston for the rest of his career, and made him the highest-paid player in Red Sox history.\nButtrouble started brewing this springwhen the Red Sox, after signing free agent third baseman Alex Bregman, asked Devers to transition from his spot at third to designated hitter.\nDevers at first flatly refused, but eventually relented. But when Red Sox first baseman Triston Casas suffered a season-ending injury in early May, the Red Sox approached Devers about taking up the first base position.\nThe 28-year-old superstar refused again, saying \"they can't expect me to play every single position out there.\"\nEven whenRed Sox owner John Henry madea flight to Kansas City, where the Red Sox were playing a road game on May 9, to personally appeal to Devers, he was rebuffed by the three-time All-Star.\nThat appears to have been a red line for the Red Sox, and Devers crossed it. On Sunday, Boston stunned the baseball world bytrading Devers to the San Francisco Giantsfor a package of three pitchers and a top minor league outfield prospect.\nMore MLB:Red Sox Legend David Ortiz Calls Out Rafael Devers' Behavior After Surprise Trade\n\"Devers was humiliated (by the Red Sox),\" Ramirez, a 12-time All-Star, said in the Gomez interview, asquoted by NJ Advanced Media. \"It's not about pride or ego. I think the team didn't respect him or communicate with him properly. I'm sure they didn't do that to (Roger) Clemens.

I'm telling you because I really wasn't doing well, and David and Pedro were busting their butts to advise me,\" Ramirez told Gomez, referring to his Boston teammates Pedro Martinez and David Ortiz — both, like Ramirez and Devers, natives of the Dominican Republic.\n\"But I was so messed up that I never let them guide me,\" Ramirez continued. \"And look at how David Ortiz has come out on top in Boston.

They moved him to be an everyday designated hitter when they signed Alex Bregman. However, when Triston Casas suffered a season-ending knee injury, they reportedly asked him to play first base.Devers apparently felt disrespectedby the request and called out chief baseball officer Craig Breslow in the media.\n\"Here in the clubhouse, thankfully, the relationship that I have with my teammates is great,\" Devers said at the time, per MassLive's Christopher Smith. \"I don't understand some of the decisions that the GM makes. Next thing you know someone in the outfield gets hurt and they want me to play in the outfield. I think I know the kind of player I am. And yeah, that's just where I stand.\"\nFast forward to his introductory press conference with the Giants, and he is suddenlywilling to change positions.\n\"I'm here to give my 100 percent, I don't put any buts, they're the men in charge and I'm here to play whatever they want me to play,\" Devers said, per the Boston Herald's Mac Cerullo.\nHis comments are disrespectful to the Red Sox organization and Breslow. He was unwilling to change positions for the team he played eight-plus seasons for, but is willing to play wherever he is asked for his new team and new general manager, Buster Posey.\nThe Giants, like the Red Sox, have an elite third baseman. Although Matt Chapman is hurt, the Red Sox plan to use Devers at DH Tuesday and work him in at first base,according to MassLive's Chris Cotillo.\nDevers is a three-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger and World Series champion.

While there might not be much the sport could do about the second point, it could look into changing the way drivers secure their place in the playoffs.\nPetty revealed his point while answering a question sent by one of his fans on X.

He took over the role from Francois Dumontier last year and immediately set out to make the event better in every way. Hinting at a growth plan to make the event one of the best Grand Prix destinations, hesaid:\n\"There was something where people wanted to make it different. We want to bring Canada to a top quartile GP. There's a path for us to get there, and we wanted to showcase that there is some improvement.\"\nThe 2026 Canadian GP has been moved from June to May 22, set to take place after the race in Miami. Paradis confirmed that the change will lead to a slight temperature variation. He said:\n\"The month of May might have been a little bit colder this year. But historically there's about a 1.5 to two degrees (Celsius) difference.\"\nHowever, the change in dates will lead to a clash with IndyCar's Indianapolis 500, which Paradis believes won't affect the numbers. In addition, he believes that despite the growing influence of F1 in the USA, with three successful Grand Prix venues, Canada's market is large enough not to lose out to competition. He said:\n\"Canada is a huge market, right? It's 40 million people. There's obviously a huge economic market. We serve really well the Northeast of North America. It's an iconic race.\n\"I'm personally waking up every day to make sure that we have a top race, and this race stays here for the next 100 years.\"\nHe added:\n\"If you ask me, why do you wake up every day in the morning? It's to try to make the race really amazing. Each time, I will improve the fan experience, the personnel experience.\"\nThe Canadian Grand Prix is under contract with F1's governing body, the FIA, until 2031. However, a rumor spread that the deal could end in 2029. Addressing the report, Paradis said:\n\"What we wanted to focus on is making sure 2025 is an amazing success we can build on.

Scheffler missed eight putts from inside 15 feet during the fourth round, which was key to him finishing five strokesbehind champion JJ Spaun.\n\"A few more putts drop today, I think it's a little different story,\" Scheffler said.\n\"My first three days, I felt like I was battling the whole time. Today I hit some shots. I hit some putts that I really thought were going in, hit some lips.\"\n\"It was just challenging. There was a lot of pitch on the greens and you got to do a lot right in order to hole putts. I was just right on the edge today.\"\n🚨⛳️😲#WATCH— World #1 Scottie Scheffler with a 3 putt bogey from 8 feet, including a 2 footer for par that didn’t even touch the hole… 🫨@SchefflerFanspic.twitter.com/6LbM7TWIm4\nDuring the fourth round, it's fair to say thatScheffler suffered from one of his greatest strengths: driving. The three-time major champion lost strokes off the tee (-0.86) and hit only seven of the 14 fairways he played.\n\"My main takeaway is I battled as hard as I did this week,\" he said.\n\"I was really proud mentally of how I was over the course of four days. I did a lot of things out there that could really kind of break a week, and I never really got that one good break that kind of propels you.\"\n\"I'd hit it this far off, and seemingly every time I did, I was punished pretty severely for it.\"\nScottie Scheffler improved as the U.S. Open progressed, carding rounds of 73, 71, 70, and 70 to finish tied for seventh at 4-over. This marks his 15th top-10 finish in 24 major championship appearances, his fourth consecutive top 10 finish, and his ninth in the last three seasons.\nMore Golf:2025 U.S. Open: Full $21.5M Payout as JJ Spaun Wins First Major\n",

And this week, he finally got what many believed he deserved.\nDespite a frustrating U.S. Open run where he had toface consequences for breaking the tee boxat Oakmont, McIlroy's season has been anything but dull.\nHe kicked off 2025 with a win at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, followed by a dramatic playoff victory at THE PLAYERS Championship, where he edged out none other thanJ.J. Spaun, who would go on to win the U.S. Open.\nBut the real breakthrough came at Augusta, where McIlroy ended an 11-year major drought and completed his long-awaited career Grand Slam by winning the Masters.\nThat win, combined with his consistent form, catapulted him to the top of the European Ryder Cup standings. And on Monday, European captain Luke Donald made it official: Rory McIlroy became the first automatic qualifier for Team Europe at the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black.\nMcIlroy acknowledged the news with a bold five-word message on Instagram:\"I'll see you at Bethpage.\"\nFor a player who's been under multiple microscopes lately, it was the kind of validation he needed.\nSince the PGA Championship, McIlroy has faced criticism for skipping media duties—something he repeated during the first two days at the U.S. Open.\nHe also withdrew from the Memorial Tournament, a signature event hosted by Jack Nicklaus, who has mentored McIlroy over the years.\nStill, his Ryder Cup legacy remains untarnished. Since debuting in 2010, McIlroy has played in seven consecutive Ryder Cups, helping Europe to five wins.\nNow, as he prepares for his eighth straight appearance, McIlroy's message is clear: he's ready to lead again.\n\"Winning a Ryder Cup away from home is one of the biggest challenges there is in golf,\"he said.\n\"We know it's going to be tough in New York, but we're all looking forward to that challenge.\"\nAs soon as the news went viral, European team captain, Luke Donald cheered up Rory posting:\"Let's go! 👏\"\nA post shared by instagram\nShane Lowry, who is one of the closest PGA Tour pros to Rory, couldn't stop himself and chimed in, commenting,\"😍🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺\"\nJustin Rose also expressed his love and respect for McIlroy as he took to X posting:\"Strong first player in team@RyderCupEurope!!! 💙💛\"\nA few days ago, Scottie Scheffler was announced as the first lock for the US Ryder Cup team captained by Keegan Bradley.\nWith Rory and Scottie sitting at OWGR No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, the Ryder Cup storyline is writing itself.\nThese two have set the tone for the 2025 season, and now they'll carry the weight of national colors at Bethpage Black, arguably one of golf's most intense cauldrons.\nMore Golf:JJ Spaun Takes Massive Leap Up World Rankings amid U.S. Open Win\n",

Battling relentless rain and awaterlogged course, Scott carded 9-over 79, tumbling from T2 to T12 and watching his hopes of a second major slip away.\n\"It was borderline unplayable... the water was so close to the surface. Like the shot I hit on 11—it's bizarre. I just don't know. It was like an aquaplane off the ground,\"Scott said post-round.\nYet, in the face of heartbreak, Scott's response was pure class. On Monday, he took to Instagram to share his gratitude:\n\"Today wasn't my day but I am still so grateful for everything this game continues to give me. Thank you @usga for hosting another incredible and historic championship. Onward,\"he posted over his Insgram profile.\nA post shared by instagram\nHis sportsmanship extended beyond social media.\nIn the locker room, Scott embraced newly crownedU.S. Open champion J.J. Spaun, offering heartfelt congratulations right after his win.\nThe moment gained even more meaning when the U.S. Open's Instagram account resurfaced a 2020 tweet from Spaun that read,\"My new swing thought... 'Adam Scott'.\"\nThe official U. S. Open handle captioned it:\"Safe to say it worked, J.J!\"\nA post shared by instagram\nScott acknowledged the post with a nod, proving that even in defeat, he remains a role model.\nHis final round may have unraveled, but his legacy as one of golf's classiest competitors only grew stronger. This was Scott's 96th consecutive major appearance, second only to the Golden Bear, Jack Nicklaus.\nWhile the trophy eluded him, his grace under pressure didn't go unnoticed.\nFor now, the grind continues. Scott will tee it up next at theTravelers ChampionshipfromJune 19–22atTPC River Highlands.\nThis will be the PGA Tour's final signature event of the season with$20 millionon the line.\nHe's also confirmed for theOpen Championship at Royal Portrush, set forJuly 17–20, where redemption may still await.\nMore Golf:Rory McIlroy Drops Ryder Cup Message after U.S. Open Flop\n",
