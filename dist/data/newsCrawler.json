      "body": "Greg Mike: Why is it critical for men to start having more open conversations about their mental health?\nDr. Ryan Breshears: That’s a great question. Men tend to delay seeking help more than women. Frankly, it’s a mortality issue. Men have higher suicide rates than women and tend to have a higher prevalence of substance abuse disorders. Anything we can do to get men talking is important.\nGreg: Got it. Then, what are some early signs of stress-related mental health issues in adults that we should be aware of?\nDr. Breshears: Increased irritability, changes in mood, decreased interest in social engagement, and insomnia—both the inability to fall asleep and waking up mid-sleep—are all important signals that a mental health problem might be emerging.\nGreg: That makes sense. So, how does treating your whole health play a role in supporting mental well-being?\nDr. Breshears: I think the days of talking about physical problems versus mental problems are over. We have a body of research and decades of science that shows the interplay between the physical and the emotional.\nGreg: How is Wellstar addressing that?\nDr. Breshears: We’re making a concerted effort to remove barriers to access. So, for example, bringing behavioral health into primary care, cardiac care, pediatrics, women’s health …We want to strategically integrate wherever patients are receiving care.\nGreg: Now, what can workplaces do to create a culture where employees feel safe to seek mental health support?\nDr. Breshears: First, I think we have to pay attention to what’s causing stress to our employees and commit to resolving those issues. Secondly, we need to establish clear pathways so people can access support without all the stumbling blocks and delays they often run into.\nGreg: How can we prioritize behavioral health as a key component of overall well-being?\nDr. Breshears: The answer lies in commitment and understanding. It’s the employer’s responsibility to promote a culture in which people can accomplish the aims of the business without compromising the physical, emotional, or spiritual well-being of their employees.\nGreg: As a leader, I’m constantly learning. I’m trying to be more understanding, more compassionate, and a better communicator with my team.\nDr. Breshears: Yes. It starts with understanding an individual’s needs. What works for me is not necessarily going to work for you, but there are some common denominators. We’re social creatures, so having environments where people come in and feel good about their day-to-day interactions is important.\nGreg: People spend so much of their lives working, you want it to be something that they’re inspired by and that they enjoy.\nDr. Breshears: So, how do you handle that work/life balance that everyone strives for?\nGreg: I wish I could say that I was better at it. I’m very obsessive-compulsive and I’m always on; I don’t have an off switch. I’m trying to learn to set boundaries because I realize that it is important, and you can get burnout.\nDr. Breshears: How does that manifest for you?\nGreg: It’s a lot about physical health, like you said. I’ll start getting sick and worn down and feeling lethargic and depressed. It means I’ve got to stop or slow down.\nDr. Breshears: So, how do you keep your energy levels up?\nGreg: I try to stay physical. If I’m out on a golf course in nature doing something active, that helps. Running is huge. I feel like the goalpost is constantly moving and that’s something I struggle with. I’m trying to take the time to appreciate my accomplishments.\nDr. Breshears: When you were younger, what kind of thoughts were you battling?\nGreg: I come from a divorced family, which was a big trigger. Art has always been therapy for me. It’s something that listens to me when no one else is around. In the beginning, a lot of what I drew was very dark; there were things in my head that I needed to get out.\nDr. Breshears: And how did your style change from dark to a positive light?\nGreg: When I started painting murals around the world, my heart started to shift. I felt like I should paint something positive. The more I put color and brightness and positivity out there, the more I saw people react, which made me feel better. It was kind of like a positive snowball effect for me.\nDr. Breshears: Out of all your work, what piece best conveys your advocacy for behavioral health awareness?\nGreg: Honestly, my Larry Loudmouf character. I was drawing this giant mouth all over and I had an idea: What if I put it on social media and see what’s on everyone else’s mind? It’s turned into this “Loudmouf says” project; the character is now the voice of something larger than me.\nDr. Breshears: Is there a correlation between how you’re feeling and what shows up in your art?\nGreg: Color is very powerful when it comes to murals. It brings people a lot of happiness and positivity when you’re driving down a city street that’s all gray buildings and you turn a corner and get blasted with color. Just create what’s in your head and bring it to life.\nVisit wellstar.org/mentalhealth\n",

      "body": "Photograph courtesy of Nicholas Church\nMany people dread a trip to the doctor’s office thanks to long wait times, inefficiencies, and Byzantine billing processes. Concierge medicine, a newer style of healthcare, is on the rise, with many Atlanta practices switching to the model to benefit the patient-doctor relationship.\nCraig Peters, MD, a concierge internist withPiedmont Internal Medicine, made the switch in April to the concierge model. One doctor in his practice had already switched, which encouraged the remaining doctors to do so. “The model is transformative, enabling unrushed visits with time to address not just urgent issues, but focus on preventative health and longevity,” he says, which is not possible in a traditional model.\nDr. Peters says that, according to recent research, the average wait time in Atlanta to see a physician in a traditional practice is 45 days, and in-office wait times can be 20 to 30 minutes for a 15-minute appointment. Piedmont Internal Medicine has people who answer the phone immediately and appointments are available the same or next day. “Our appointments are leisurely, 30 minutes on average for routine matters, and 60 minutes for the annual comprehensive assessment.”\nNicholas Church, MD, opened his concierge practice,Somerset Medical, this year. Originally from Somerset, England, he began his career in American healthcare at Emory Healthcare in 2007 as a general internist. “I saw the doctor-patient relationship get squeezed and compromised. There was so much red tape; I’d get up at 5 a.m. and spend three hours on paperwork before even seeing a patient,” he said.\nHis practice also gives access to wellness offerings such as IV therapy and advanced cancer screenings in addition to regular membership services. He’s even been able to meet a patient in the emergency room and guide them through the admissions process, and check up on them. “The real advantage is access,” he says. “This is a personal relationship. In my last role, I had 5,000 patients. Concierge doctors typically have about 200 patients.”\nConcierge models can be cost-prohibitive, with average practice membership ranging from $2,000 to $5,000, and in some parts of the country, up to $10,000. While expensive, it helps the practices keep their patient pool smaller, allowing the doctors to devote more time.\nThere are also ethical implications to the trend. According to Dorothy Leone-Glasser, the executive director of the nonprofitAdvocates for Responsible Care(ARxC), this creates even more disparity and lack of equity. “We already have a shortage of physicians in Georgia, especially primary care physicians, and choosing patients based on the ability to pay limits access,” she says. “Physicians take an oath and have a moral obligation to serve all patients, so this raises concerns about neglecting their duty of care.” She says one way that concierge practices can counter this impact is by giving back to underserved communities.\n",

      "body": "Photograph by Bonnie Heath\nMandy Smith, a certified family nurse practitioner, has had their share of difficulties as a queer person working in healthcare. Although Smith, who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, has never experienced any overt hostility, they felt for a long time that being fully true to themselves might compromise their sense of safety at work. Throughout nursing school and later, working in various hospitals, Smith always felt the need to “perform” in front of patients and colleagues.\n“That’s been a really interesting part of starting [All Y’all],” Smith says. “Providing affirming care to other people . . . It’s been so affirming for me. I get to show up at work every day as exactly who I am, not holding anything back.”\nAll Y’all, which opened last September, is one of Atlanta’s first queer-run primary care providers that specializes in gender-affirming care such as gender transition support. While the practice is open to all adult patients, Smith is most passionate about ensuring that transgender individuals have a safe space to receive healthcare.\nThis is more important than ever in the wake of new anti-trans legislation across the country. Twenty-seven states have now passed laws restricting gender-affirming care for transgender youth, and research by the Human Rights Campaign found thatmore than half of transgender adults have considered moving states in response to gender-affirming care restrictions.\nAbout 46 percent of All Y’all patients are transgender or gender expansive, and Smith believes that as a nonbinary person themself, they are uniquely well suited to be those patients’ practitioner. “There’s just something about knowing that the person across from you has walked some of the same road you’ve walked,” Smith says. “I think it helps to foster trust and a sense of safety, and for a lot of patients, it’s the first time they’re really getting to experience that in a healthcare setting.”\nSince All Y’all launched last year, Smith has built a loyal patient base from neighborhood word of mouth and small community events they have organized. Smith hosts a regular series called “TEA on Tuesday,” where people can learn more about testosterone and estrogen administration (hence the “tea”), view demonstrations, and use practice pads to learn how to inject the hormones. In the long run, Smith hopes to establish a scholarship fund that will support queer-identifying people pursuing careers in healthcare, to help foster the next generation of affirming providers.\nWhile All Y’all will continue providing specialized resources for LGBTQ+ individuals, Smith welcomes all kinds of patients. “A lot of people—regardless of who they are, where they come from—have had traumatizing medical experiences,” they say. “That’s truly where the name [All Y’all] came from. I’m really passionate about taking care of my queer community, but I want to take care of everyone. Everyone deserves to be affirmed.”\nThis article appears in ourMay 2025 issue.\n",

      "body": "Photograph courtesy of Stronger Now Gym\nAs we age, muscle mass naturally declines,accelerating after age 50. This can lead to decreased endurance, strength, and flexibility, all of which are important for daily functions like balance, stability, and coordination. That’s something Alex Mitchell, the founder ofStronger Now Gymin Sandy Springs, wants to change for his clients.\nMitchell started in traditional fitness, working as a personal training manager for brands like Crunch and L.A. Fitness. “All my trainers wanted to work with the same kind of client, someone between 15 and 45 who was generally healthy and had specific goals,” he says. No one wanted to work out with older clients, but Mitchell loved them. “They had great stories, were generally easy to work with, and stayed consistent,” he says.\nPhotograph courtesy of Stronger Now Gym\nThat experience led him to believe that there was a need for a gym just for these clients. He opened in 2020, exclusively catering to an over-50 crowd. Stronger Now Gym offers personal training sessions and group training sessions where clients can get stronger with dedicated support from trained professionals who understand their unique needs, whether it’s to pick up a heavy grandchild in a supported way or meet a swimming goal at their local gym.\n“In exercise, you have to walk the line between doing enough to make the change so that you’re better and stronger, but overdoing it can cause injury or acute soreness. That line is thick and easy to walk when you’re in your 20s, and it gets thinner as you age,” he says.\nPhotograph courtesy of Stronger Now Gym\nWhile Mitchell and his team train everyone individually, there’s a common thread. “Our clients come to us because they have noticed their bodies are losing capacity that they’re not willing to go without,” he says. He and his team of certified professional barbell coaches, exercise physiologists, biomedical physiologists, and lifestyle medicine practitioners help them get stronger to retain those abilities under unique supervision where trainers can take into account things like medical history and previous injury.\nOne of the most important parts of Stronger Now Gym is the social aspect. “We know we need to exercise, eat healthy, and be social [to age well],” he says. “The social part of this gym has taken off. Our clients are all in a similar stage of life, so it’s easy for them to make friends, something that’s incredibly important for this population.”\n",

Before foundingLemon Perfect, a lemon beverage company, he was a collegiate basketball coach for the University of Nevada, Reno. A chance encounter led him to discover how many nutrition fanatics were starting their days with water with a squeeze of lemon for the potential dietary and wellness benefits.\nHe was sold on the product, but not the strategy. “Lemon water became a part of my morning routine, but it sucked,” he says. “You have to buy the lemons, cut them, and squeeze the juice. It’s bland, it’s horrifying. I had a moment where I was like, ‘Can we make this taste good?’”\nToday, his eight-year-old company Lemon Perfect is valued at $200 million and has investors including Beyoncé behind it. They have sold over 120 million bottles of lemon water, which comes in flavors such as peach, lime, and sunshine tea. It has 10 calories and zero sugar, making it an attractive beverage in today’s health-conscious world.\n“Lemon water is a great hydration boost, and it encourages people to drink more water. It’s a great source of vitamin C, which is an antioxidant that supports immune function, skin health, and digestion,” he says. There’s some evidence to back up Hufnagel’s claims: vitamin C has been shown to contribute to ahealthy heartandaid in digestion, and people tend todrink more waterwhen it tastes better, too.\nHufnagel moved his company to Atlanta in 2021, purely as a business decision, when the company first began working with Publix. “Atlanta is wonderful, but it’s more than just being around other beverage brands. It’s a great place forstart-up culture and entrepreneurs. You can’t beat the cost of living, the climate, the culture, the talent, and of course the airport,” he says.\n",

      "body": "If you’re feeling stressed lately, you’re not alone: A recentWalletHubstudy found that 77 percent of adults are stressed, and that Georgia is one of the most stressed states in the country, with factors such as health, family relationships, finances, and work considered. While therapy and medication are two of the most prevalent ways to reduce stress and anxiety, there is one often underutilized method that’s been scientifically proven to reduce stress quickly: tapping, or Emotional Freedom Technique.\nThe technique combines acupressure and psychology to balance the body and reduce stress, often immediately.Melissa Lester, LCSW, is a Sandy Springs-based psychotherapist who uses tapping in her private practice, as well as in her work with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Georgia School Counselors Association, and Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute, among other organizations.\n“Tapping activates the 10 largest energy channels in the body where Western science has proven that energy travels fastest,” she explains. “By tapping, you can quickly process what hasn’t been processed, such as trauma or stress, and bring the nervous system back into a natural state of calm and relaxation, going from activation to deactivation.” According to Lester, tapping can help reduce blood pressure, cortisol, anxiety, and physical pain severity.\nWhile Lester and other professionals incorporate it into their practices, it can be done anytime, anywhere, with the help of free resources like apps and videos online. To do it, sit comfortably and close your eyes. Then, gently tap points across the face and body as guided by an instructional video, such as the eyebrows, under the eyes, and collarbone, while listening to and repeating affirmations. Online tapping resources will guide you where to tap and when, and some sessions can last as few as three minutes.\nLester uses it clinically to help with things such as interrupting cravings for substance abuse patients or intercepting panic attacks, or those suffering from PTSD. But she is adamant that it can be done anywhere by anybody in times of need. “You can do it in a parking lot or bathroom stall at work, anywhere you need to slow down your nervous system,” she says.\n",

The startup was founded by Vedant Pradeep and Ziyi Gao, two Georgia Tech graduates who realized there was no middle ground to help those who didn’t have a clinical problem with alcohol but wanted to change their habits.\n“We were fascinated by the idea of the peak human condition, where someone is the best version of themselves mentally, physically, and emotionally,” Pradeep explains. He acknowledges that was a bit esoteric, so they looked into solving a targeted problem. Pradeep has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and the pair of engineers set about trying to help those with similar conditions. “We began talking to people with OCD and realized that a lot of them were using alcohol as a way to self-medicate,” he says.\nThey switched gears, and now Reframe focuses solely on a user’s relationship with alcohol. The app uses science to help users develop coping strategies. “Alcohol is not the problem itself; it’s a symptom. It’s a bad coping strategy,” he says. “We help users figure out what the real problem is and how to cope in a healthier fashion.”\nPaid users get personalized programs that can help with individual goals, monitoring progress, meditations, dream tracking, and more. Everything is science-based and vetted by medical professionals, including three Emory University doctors on the medical advisory board. There are lessons, exercises, and content that take about 10 minutes a day to do, with the hope of changing behavior patterns over time. There’s also a community aspect, where users can talk directly with each other and lend accountability and support 24/7, and one-on-one coaching for anyone looking for extra help.\nTo date, Reframe has helped over one million people change their relationship with alcohol and has raised over $27 million in funds through three rounds, including $14 million from David Cummings of Atlanta Ventures, who was the app’s first investor.\n“We’ve found that the real way to help someone cut back is to help them not need alcohol in the first place. To do that, you need to help them manage their emotions and build healthier habits,” Pradeep says.\n",

      "name": "Atlanta’s allergy season can be brutal. Here’s how to help your kids cope.",
      "body": "Photograph by galitskaya/iStock/Getty Images Plus\nAny Atlantan who suffers from allergies knows that spring and fall can be brutal, and it doesn’t feel good to allergy sufferers to see that the city keeps breaking its own pollen count records. It can be even worse for children, though, who aren’t as good at identifying symptoms and communicating their discomfort.\nAtlanta’s allergy season can feel like it lasts all year, and that’s because it kind of does, depending on what you are allergic to. Dr. Sofia Edwards-Salmon, an allergist withChacko Allergy, says tree pollen kicks off in February and goes until April, then grass pollen hits around May and June. High summer offers slight relief before weed pollen stirs up around September to October. It’s the price we pay for living in the “City in the Forest,” as lush surroundings mean more opportunities for irritation.\nAccording to Dr. Edwards-Salmon, children can develop environmental allergies after age two. The mean age is 10, and it is uncommon for seasonal allergies to appear in infants and toddlers under age two. “There are a lot of theories as to why allergies develop, including things like an increased length of pollen seasons and lifestyle changes, like less vitamin D and less parasite exposure [to help train the immune system],” she says.\nWhile avoidance is the first line of defense, Dr. Edwards-Salmon knows how that can be difficult for children and family life in general. She suggests going outside during specific times. “Mornings tend to have lower pollen counts than the afternoons and evenings,” she says. She also suggests rinsing off and changing clothes after coming inside, as well as wiping down pets who might track in pollen. If an older child is amenable, wearing a mask can be a good idea.\nInterestingly, the management of seasonal allergies hasn’t changed all that much, with antihistamines offering the most effective relief. Some parents might want to reach for Benadryl (diphenhydramine), but Dr. Edwards-Salmon suggests other options for children, as chronic Benadryl use is now associated with more side effects than newer first-generation antihistamines like cetirizine (Zyrtec), fenxofanadine (Allegra) and loratidine (Claritin), all of which come in children’s versions. “My go-to is a nasal spray over an oral medication since they deliver medication directly to the most affected areas. They are more effective if used regularly and correctly,” she says.\nTo do so, have your child look at their feet when spraying into their noses, spray away from the middle of their nose, and have them breathe normally, she says. If symptoms persist and feel chronic, she recommends you book your child an allergy test to get more specific therapy, including allergy shots, which expose the immune system to the allergens in increasing amounts to build up tolerance.\n",

      "body": "Photograph courtesy of Dr. Danielle Drobbin\nChiropractic care has become more prevalent over the last few decades as people seek alternatives to traditional Western medicine, says Dr. Danielle Drobbin, owner and chiropractor atMidtown Family Wellness. There are currently 70,000 chiropractors in the country, according to the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners. “More and more people are becoming discouraged with our current healthcare system. People are looking for alternatives,” she says. That includes chiropractic services for pregnant women and the parents of children looking for relief or help, many of whom are discovering the option on social media sites like TikTok.\nMisalignments, which cause muscle tightening and pain, become more complex when treating these populations, she says. To treat them, chiropractors can receive additional schooling and certifications, including the Webster Technique, a gentle approach focused on pregnant bodies. Specific pregnancy and postpartum conditions such as sciatica, nausea, acid reflux, mastitis, and breastfeeding latching issues could all potentially be helped through chiropractic care as can pediatric issues such as colic, torticollis, reflux, and ear infections. (Dr. Drobbin has sixpeer-reviewed case studiesunder her belt in for these conditions.)\nLike Western medicine, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for specialized chiropractic care. Depending on a patient’s situation and body, it could be only a few sessions before they feel relief or it could be much longer, with proactive preventative care an essential part of the chiropractic process. “Just like you get your teeth cleaned to prevent cavities, it’s important to take care of the bones that house the nerves of your central nervous system to prevent future degeneration of discs and the health of the nerves,” she says.\nHowever, she says that she has better results when pregnant women come to her at the beginning of their motherhood journey. “People come to me as a last resort,” she says. Those that come early in the process have little to no pregnancy symptoms, better births, better postpartum recovery, and few or no issues with their babies, she says.\nFrom her perspective, her services aren’t in competition with traditional medicine but rather a complement, and one people seek out in a healthcare system that has issues. “We believe in a foundation of a strong, healthy spine, immune system, and nervous system,” she says. “Go to a medical doctor if you need to, and or come see us. Options are power.”\nTo find a practitioner specializing in pregnancy and pediatric care, she recommends visitingicpa4kids.org.\n",

It will be available in showrooms in late summer.\nThe collection draws on Susan’s global travels as well as her longtime interest in ancient civilizations. “When designing the collection, I thought about what has sustained me over the years and what I identify with most,” she says. “In my travels, I usually find myself at the base of a volcano or standing in an archaeological site. I’m endlessly fascinated by the raw power and beauty of the earth.”\nPhotograph courtesy of Baker\nPhotograph courtesy of Baker\nThe designer channeled that interest into a curated line of tables, sofas, chairs, beds, mirrors, and lighting that connect people with nature. The pieces incorporate organic materials, such as cast bronze, leathered stone, polished marble, and oak, and introduce four new wood finishes, seven new bronze finishes, and two new stones—leathered Belgian Bluestone and Namibia White Marble. Lamps are crafted in Italy and showcase materials such as white onyx and shagreen.\nEach piece in the collection is named after an ancient civilization, a volcanic region, or an earth element and is intended to evoke energy and a sense of discovery. A few highlights in the line include the Fira Lounge Chair, which pairs cast bronze with sophisticated upholstery; the Pele Console, crafted with an ombre bronze base and a polished Namibia White Marble top; the Teide Counter Stool, featuring a bronze-planted stainless steel base and a plush upholstered top layer; and the Forge Desk, which pairs a bronze base and frame with a tower of Starphire glass shelves.\nPhotograph courtesy of Baker\nPhotograph courtesy of Baker\nThe relationship between the heritage furniture brand and the award-winning designer was a match made in heaven. “It was a whirlwind romance,” Susan says. “Baker values craftsmanship and timeless design, and they understand the importance of beautiful finish work. They are the perfect partner, and I hope for more collaboration in the future.”\nSusan founded her eponymous design company in 2018 after nearly 20 years as a partner at the architecture and design firm McAlpine. She has been recognized inElle Decor’sA-List of top interior designers in the world and co-authoredArt of the House: Reflections on Design,a book that details her approach to creating striking interiors.

      "body": "Courtesy of Broad Street BBQ\nSouth Downtown is heating up. The team behindSammy’sin Adair Park is working on a new venture called Broad Street BBQ, slated to open in spring 2026. Located across from the planned El Tesoro, Broad Street will feature a full-service smokehouse with counter-service barbecue, a to-go window, and a craft cocktail bar. It’s the brainchild of Jason Furst and Sam Pinner, whose culinary partnership dates back to a pandemic-era stint smoking meats on Bainbridge Island, Washington.\n“We were doing barbecue out of [Cafe] Hitchcock during Covid,” Furst recalls. “It got very busy very quickly—lines down the street every Saturday, even in the rain.” Though their current project, Sammy’s, is more focused on coffee and sandwiches, it includes barbecue elements like smoked pork on the Cuban and a smoked brisket pastrami Reuben that hint at what’s to come at Broad Street.\nExpect a mix of traditional and playful barbecue offerings: brisket and smoked pork served as sandwiches or platters, wings coated in a house-made spicy-sweet-tangy sauce, and Southern-style sides like hoecakes, baked beans, and mac and cheese. One potential standout is Pinner’s slaw, based on his mother’s mayo-heavy, crunchy, pickle-forward recipe. He’s also developing a collard green lasagna.\nCourtesy of Sammy's\nDraft beer will be “as local as possible” with five rotating taps plus Miller Lite. Wines will lean old-world and seasonal, with smaller 4-ounce pours available. The cocktail program will be helmed by Connor Hammond, a former bar lead at BoccaLupo who joined Furst and Pinner atSammy’s. Known for using advanced culinary techniques in his drinks—think freeze-drying and medical-grade suppression freezing—Hammond is building a menu that balances speed and sophistication. Look for an approximately 10-drink cocktail list, including some batched classics. “Let’s make some of the best drinks in the city, if not beyond,” Furst says.\nThe space—just blocks from Mercedes-Benz Stadium and adjacent to the Five Points MARTA station—features archways, garage doors, and an exterior mural of the American flag in playful bubble letters. “The mural really lends itself to barbecue,” Furst says.\nHe and Pinner plan to take advantage of the layout’s multiple storefronts to offer different experiences within the same location, including a 12-seat bar, communal couch-style lounge seating, and a takeout window. The garage doors will open onto Mitchell Street, offering guests a front-row view of the pitmasters and their signature Lane smoker—already in use at Sammy’s. Toward Broad Street, the takeout window will serve barbecue sandwiches, plates, and sides to-go, while the MARTA-facing side of the building houses the kitchen and cocktail bar.\nA Broad Street BBQ pop-up planned for later this summer at Sammy’s.\n“No matter what we do, we’re going to do it right,” Furst says. “Downtown Atlanta deserves that.”\n",

      "body": "Courtesy of Buckhead Art & Company\nIn 2023, a human resources executive with a passion for fine art took a leap and purchased the galleryBuckhead Art & Company, which originally opened in 2016.\n“I had always been an art collector and was looking to merge my love of curated events with art,” says Karimah McFarlane, who previously led market human resources for Google’s Southeast division; while there, she drew on her collector sensibilities to select art for the company’s West Peachtree Street building. “I found this space and thought,This is just perfect. It’s in Buckhead, a destination for people from around the world.”\nMcFarlane’s mission for the gallery is “to make art accessible to everybody and to have difficult conversations with people whose paths wouldn’t cross,” she says. “And let them know that we actually have more in common than we think.”\nThat mission infuses the thought-provoking exhibitions and performances, community events, and collaborative projects that rotate through the 4,000-square-foot contemporary fine art gallery.\nThis month, Buckhead Art & Company will hostSoul Reflections: Portraits of Presence, a tribute to the essence of Black humanity, intended to spark dialogue about art, identity, and community. The exhibition, which runs June 12 to June 27 to align with Juneteenth, will showcase the work of painterJeffery Beckham Jr.and photographer and filmmakerParrish Lewis.\nDrawing from Beckham’s collectionsKingdom and CrownsandVisions and Dreamsand Lewis’sYou Got Souland his “portrait experience” sessions, each piece explores how lived experiences shape our spirit. To foster connections throughout the exhibition, McFarlane will host related programming, including artist talks, screenings of Parrish’s past film work, and a portrait sitting for guests.\nBeckham’s paintings fromKingdom and Crownsconsider the Black experience through a chessboard lens. “The king and queen rule with purpose, power, and self-determination charting their course and shaping destiny,” Beckham says. “Young people grab ahold of their future, thinking multiple moves ahead. It’s literally the idea that resilience, intellect, and power are required today.”\nIn addition to portrait photography, Lewis shoots movie posters and billboards for major motion pictures such asCandymanand directs commercials, music videos, and short films. “My genre is having that human connection and preserving special moments,” says Lewis. His portraits forSoul Reflectionsfeature a range of people who have inspired Lewis along his journey, including several remarkable images of dancers: Intentionally blurred, the portraits capture the dancers’ essence, even as they lose themselves in a performance.\nMcFarlane, who still works full-time in human resources, now with the software company Workday, is as interested in cultivating artists’ careers as she is in showcasing their work. The gallery represents more than 30 artists of diverse backgrounds, each of whom she coaches to “be a full-time artist who knows how to run a business.” She directs 5 to 10 percent of sales to help represented artists cover their supplies and, in 2024, started a nonprofit foundation arm that offers career development workshops, facilitates peer mentoring, and provides financial support.\n“My whole goal is to represent you, find people who love you, and help you be the best version of you,” McFarlane pledges to her artists. “My superpower is making connections.”\nThis article appears in ourJune 2025 issue.\n",

      "name": "Fifty years after the fall of Saigon, a thriving Vietnamese community calls Atlanta home",
      "body": "Photograph by Audra Melton\nAbout 30 pairs of shoesare perched on a rack outside the door atChùa Quang Minh, Georgia’s oldest Vietnamese Buddhist temple, taken off as a gesture of respect. Devotees sit on floor cushions inside the hall for an evening meditation session. Carved golden dragons with pearls in their mouths wind around red wooden pillars at the front of the room, and offerings of fruit and flowers adorn each altar. The hall is quiet while the session is underway, but visually vibrant.\nThe meditation leader breaks the silence.\n“Visualize any pain deep in your heart as smoke,” he says. “Then take a deep breath—and release. Take a deep breath—and release. Take a deep breath—and release.”\nPeople have gathered at Chùa Quang Minh to pray, learn, and socialize since the temple opened just south of Grant Park in 1983. The congregation is more diverse today than ever before, but it has always included survivors of the war in Vietnam and their children. As they meditate, some of them are visualizing the release of the pain from that time that lingers deep in their hearts.\nLam Ngo is the president of the temple’s board. He thinks the teachings from tonight’s meditation are relevant to everyone, and that forgiveness is valuable because it brings peace to the person who forgives. At the same time, releasing the pain of the past can be particularly difficult for some who suffered the trauma of the Vietnam War.\n“Some people have lost their whole family, all their dear ones, their home, their brothers and siblings,” Ngo says. “Or imagine you spend your youth in a reeducation camp, and you work like a slave. People are not going to forget that easily.”\nThis spring marks 50 years since the fall of Saigon—an event many refugees call “the day we lost the country.” A turbulent postwar era followed, with South Vietnamese people suffering imprisonment and persecution by the Communist regime. At that time, there was hardly a Vietnamese presence in Georgia. But in the decades since, metro Atlanta’s Vietnamese population has grown immensely and now ranks as the ninth-largest Viet community in the United States.\n“We cannot change the past,” Ngo says. “But we can change the present and the future, if we understand the history.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nNorth Vietnam took control of Saigonon April 30, 1975, resulting in the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. It marked the end of a 20-year civil war that pitted Communist North Vietnam and its allies against the U.S.-backed government in South Vietnam.\nThe United States, which had been embroiled in the conflict on the ground since 1965, executed a chaotic evacuation of its soldiers from Saigon, along with thousands of South Vietnamese civilians and orphans, and third-country nationals. Additional evacuation efforts were led by the South Vietnamese.\nThe first Vietnamese evacuees to resettle in Atlanta arrived here just a few weeks later. By the autumn of 1975, there were about 400 Vietnamese refugees in the Atlanta area, and within two years, that number almost doubled. Local nonprofit organizations such asVilla Internationaland Catholic Social Services of Atlanta (nowCatholic Charities Atlanta) helped them resettle.\nIn the late 1970s and especially the 1980s, the U.S. Vietnamese population increased dramatically as refugees known as “boat people” desperately fled South Vietnam—often by whatever means possible. The journey at sea was risky, with pirates, storms, and small leaky boats, and hundreds of thousands of boat people did not survive. But those who made it to refugee camps in other regions of Southeast Asia, and then ultimately to the U.S., formed new Vietnamese enclaves in Atlanta and other cities.\nSeveral social agencies’ offices were in the Buford Highway area at that time. Plus, that area was accessible by public transit and had many low-cost housing options. The thoroughfare quickly became an anchor for Vietnamese refugees and other immigrant communities.\nTheCenter for Pan Asian Community Serviceshas served the Buford Highway area since 1980. John Nguyen, who now teaches classes at the center, was only a child when his parents put him on a boat with some other relatives, not knowing if they would ever see him again. They hoped he would find a safer, better life in the West.\nAfter more than a year in refugee camps in Malaysia and the Philippines, Nguyen arrived in Atlanta when he was 13. The International Rescue Committee helped Nguyen find his brother, who had arrived in Atlanta on his own a while earlier. As teenagers with no other relatives in town, they lived in their own apartment together near Buford Highway.\n“I wanted to go to school, but I couldn’t because of the language barrier,” Nguyen says. “So I just found odd jobs here and there and, at the same time, studied for the GED.”\nDuring Nguyen’s early days in Atlanta, there weren’t many ways to reconnect with Vietnamese culture. There was only one restaurant that served Vietnamese food, and he says it wasn’t an authentic taste of home. But as more and more refugees settled into life in Atlanta and sponsored their family members to immigrate in the 1990s, Vietnamese supermarkets, bookstores, video stores, restaurants, and services popped up along Buford Highway.\nTo Nguyen, it felt a little like Saigon.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nIn the early 2000s,Vietnamese immigrants and other Asian American communities started shifting north, from DeKalb County into Gwinnett County. The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority launched bus service to Gwinnett in 2001, improving accessibility. Plus, Gwinnett offered newer, bigger homes, and after a few decades in the U.S., many immigrants had accumulated the wealth to buy them.\nEntrepreneurship was, and still is, one of the most effective ways for immigrants to build capital when they cannot pursue the same kind of work in the U.S. that they did in their home countries.\nBoat People SOS, an international social services organization with a branch office in Norcross, has a small-business support program that helps about 50 to 100 immigrant-owned businesses every year. “[Vietnamese immigrants] normally start their business by saving up money, or they just borrow money from relatives,” says Trinh Pham, who was a refugee herself and is now the organization’s executive director in Atlanta. “But there are so many other assistance opportunities from the government that they don’t know how to access.”\nBoat People SOS helps immigrants access those financial resources for their businesses, and assists with other needs such as licenses and documents, marketing, new technology tools, and education about occupational hazards.\nNail salons, restaurants, boba (tea) shops, and snack shops are some of the most common choices for Vietnamese entrepreneurs, Pham says.\nThe organization’s office is next to a shopping plaza anchored byHong Kong Supermarket, one of the largest and oldest Vietnamese-owned businesses in the Atlanta metro area. The plaza is home to restaurants, jewelers, hair salons, medical offices, gift shops, and more. Most of them are Vietnamese-owned. Vietnamese customers from out of state—Florida, Tennessee, the Carolinas—make day trips on weekends to eat, shop, and get services here.\nTommy Nguyen and his family openedWow Banh Mi & Phoin the Hong Kong Supermarket plaza in 2022, replacing a seafood restaurant they had operated in the same spot. They are set to open a second Wow Banh Mi location this summer in Midtown.\nIn addition to working at the restaurants, Nguyen is a real-estate agent. “I’m a businessman,” he says. “I see anything we can do to make a living, and I do it.”\nThe restaurant gets all kinds of customers. Nguyen thinks non-Vietnamese Americans are drawn to Vietnamese cuisine because healthy eating has become a priority for them, and many Vietnamese dishes, with plenty of vegetables but little oil, are seen as good choices.\nNguyen has seen other Vietnamese entrepreneurs embrace the recent boom in boba tea shops, a Taiwanese export that’s become popular across the West. But he sees boba shops as a trend that could come and go. So his family’s strategy has been to open restaurants, which he thinks will be more sustainable. “If you could only afford one, will you get your food or your drink?” he says.\nAccording to 2021 census data,at least 48,000 self-identified Vietnamese people live in metro Atlanta, and more than half of them reside in Gwinnett County. Pham says this is probably a low estimate.\n“We are never happy with the number on the census, because most of themdon’t respond,” she says. “In reality, some people say we could be double or triple that number.”\nGeorgia’s Vietnamese population has been growing as immigrants relocate here from other states and newcomers still arrive directly from Vietnam. Some have waited their entire lives for a relative in the U.S. to be able to sponsor their immigration by taking temporary financial responsibility for them until they get on their feet.\nOn a Saturday morning in February, five students ranging from 36 to 59 years old are seated in a classroom at the Center for Pan Asian Community Services office, each equipped with a textbook, a notebook, and pens. For brain fuel, a tall plastic jar in the middle of the table is filled with caffeinated, coffee-flavored hard candies called Kopiko—a Southeast Asian classic.\nThe students have their green cards, and their sights are set on citizenship. They spend six hours in this classroom every Saturday to prepare for their naturalization interviews and tests. Attendance is lower today than usual because many of the regular students are busy with Lunar New Year (Tết) festivities.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nJohn Nguyen has led this class for the past nine years. He opens by drilling the students in English with questions they will be asked in their interviews. When he asks one student, “What is your race?” she stumbles over her answer, accidentally making a pun. Nguyen switches to Vietnamese to crack a joke in response, and everyone laughs.\n“I’m dying,” Nguyen says, with his hand on his forehead. “This happens every time. There’s always something funny.” He keeps the energy in the room light to help the students stay engaged with the dry and sometimes difficult material.\nNguyen has come a long way since the days when he and his brother were struggling to survive as teens in a new city and culture. He ultimately earned his GED, attended community college, and completed a bachelor’s degree in visual communications. Since then, he has worked for advertising and marketing agencies.\nIn the early 2000s, he was able to sponsor his mother, father, and remaining siblings to join him in Georgia—the first time he had seen them since he set sail on the refugee boat as a child. Now he leverages his experience and knowledge to help others who are adjusting to life in the U.S., as he and his family had to.\n“When I came over here, I didn’t have these kinds of resources,” Nguyen says. “I felt like there was a need for it. So we started the citizenship program.”\nNguyen says his students have a 98 percent success rate in achieving citizenship after his class. Some pass the test the first time; others have to try a few times. “They say, ‘I’m not gonna quit until I pass,’” he says.\nBut American politics have made their way into his classroom. A federal grant was supplying the monthly $6,700 that the organization requires to run three citizenship classes per week in different languages. That February morning was Nguyen’s last session before an executive order to freeze federal funds was issued by the White House. The class is now paused indefinitely.\n“The students were so sad when I delivered the news,” Nguyen says. He hopes to provide ad hoc support to individual students by phone until funding is restored or another funder fills the gap.\nA lot can happen in 50 years.The Vietnamese community has grown into an important part of Atlanta’s cultural patchwork, and the children of the early waves of refugees and immigrants have grown up. Now young adults, they are the ones who get to define what it means for their generations to be Vietnamese in America.\nJason Do came to the United States with his parents and brother in the early 1990s, when he was five years old, and arrived in Atlanta to join relatives who had previously resettled here.\nGrowing up, Do celebrated major Vietnamese holidays with his family, but he didn’t become seriously interested in the cultural traditions until he joined theVietnamese Student Association at Georgia State University. The association connected him with Georgia’s broader Vietnamese community, including theYoung Vietnamese Association of Georgia, a branch of the Vietnamese American Community of Georgia—a prominent social organization with a legacy going back more than 30 years.\n“The majority of those members, they were born here—maybe in the late ’90s and early 2000s,” Do says. “Their parents had to find jobs and work to provide for the family. They didn’t have time to teach the kids about Vietnamese culture and traditions. So that’s where the association comes in, to try to help.”\nAs someone who was born in Vietnam and immigrated in early childhood, Do belongs to what scholars call the “1.5 generation,” which he himself calls the “middle generation.” With the association, Do has taught young adults about Vietnamese traditions, while in his career as an insurance agent and mortgage loan officer, he supports older Vietnamese clients in the home-buying process by working with them in their preferred language.\n“We’re able to help the younger generation to know about Vietnamese culture and also help the older generation in the sense of assimilating to American culture,” he says.\nDo and his wife have two children: a son who is two and a daughter who is five. “I make them speak Vietnamese at home,” Do says, “especially to my parents, because my parents don’t know much English. They know a little bit to get by, but their preferred communication will still be Vietnamese.”\nSoon, he might enroll his daughter in a Vietnamese language class. He hopes his children will want to fully participate in Vietnamese traditions as they grow up.\n“Of course not forcing them, just introducing them to it—if they like it, then they can continue,” he says. “They live in America, but I still want them to remember their heritage and where their family came from.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nCulture-sharing is an everyday normfor Generation Z, the most diverse generation in U.S. history, born roughly between 1997 and 2012. Now on the cusp of adulthood, or already navigating the early years of it, some Vietnamese American Gen Zers are enthusiastically sharing the traditions they learned in their upbringing with the rest of the world.\nWith a backdrop of the setting sun, clanging cymbals and pounding drums resonate through the neighborhood around Chùa Quang Minh on a Sunday evening to close out the Lunar New Year week. Invigorated by the instruments, pairs of athletic dancers on the Hong Hing Lion Dance Team bring to life three lions: gold, red, and pink. A man in a smiling Buddha costume leads the lions around the temple grounds as they bow in reverence to each statue and altar, delighting the audience along the way with acrobatic moves and bits of comedy.\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nLion dance originated in China, but it’s important in Vietnamese tradition too. Lion dancers often perform at weddings, festivals, grand openings, and other big events. During the Lunar New Year season, Hong Hing’s schedule is packed with back-to-back performances at temples, churches, and Asian-owned businesses around the Atlanta area, as well as at one of the two major Tết festivals.\n“I think it’s very important to understand where you come from; what your roots are,” says Kenn Ho, one of Hong Hing’s team leaders. “When I’m performing, I feel like I’m doing my best to keep the culture and the art and sport of lion dance alive.”\nHo cofounded Hong Hing in 2023 with three friends. One of them is Brian Nguyen, who says lion dance has been key for him to connect with Georgia’s Vietnamese community.\n“I’m grateful that my parents were able to give me the opportunity to do this,” Nguyen says. Then he adds, laughing a little, “If they see this—I’m sorry that I got bad grades because I did lion dancing too much.”\nHo and Nguyen have engaged with their Vietnamese heritage through lion dance, but the group is not exclusive to Vietnamese American members. The dancers, all in their teens and 20s, represent a range of ethnic and racial identities, as do the audiences that seek out their performances.\n“We’re looking to branch out and hopefully get [more] non-Asian people to join,” Ho says. “I think that would be a good way to have diversity within our team.”\nPhotograph by Audra Melton\nVietnamese student associationsat Atlanta-area institutions are a popular way for young Vietnamese Americans to grow their understanding of Vietnamese culture and share it with others.\nVincent Huynh, a pre-dentistry student at Emory University who is from Lilburn, is copresident of theEmory Vietnamese Student Associationthis year. His father was one of the founding members of the Emory chapter in the early 1990s. “It’s kind of big shoes to fill,” Huynh says. “But we always want to do bigger and better.”\nWhen his father and a few other students were getting the club up and running, it was “just pizza parties,” Huynh says. Thirty years later, it’s a thriving, dynamic group that hosts at least two events per month, where students from all cultural backgrounds enjoy Vietnamese snacks, drinks, games, and holiday activities.\nThe club’s biggest event is Emory by Night, a springtime gala open to the entire Emory community and beyond. Inspired byParis by Night, a variety show ubiquitous in Vietnamese American homes in the ’80s and ’90s, the gala features music, dance, and sketch performances.\n“My parents used to always watchParis by Night,” says Jena Vo, an Emory accounting student from Marietta on the organization’s executive board. “It’s very nostalgic.”\nTo illustrate the diversity of culture within Vietnam, each year the Emory association chooses a different region as the gala theme. Last year’s theme was “Sounds of the River,” in reference to Miền Tây in the Mekong Delta; in 2023, “City of Lanterns,” highlighted Hội An on the coast. “I think it’s a really cool way to showcase different areas and cities that are not as commonly known,” Vo says.\nThis year’s theme was a poignant and timely ode to the heart of South Vietnam: “A Love Letter to Saigon.”\nSometimes the generations clash, says Angela Tran, a third-year nursing student and the other current copresident of the Emory association. She thinks traditional Vietnamese culture can be patriarchal, and there are certain parts she doesn’t agree with. But she respects what her parents’ generation went through after Saigon fell and how they’ve “rebuilt their lives from scratch here,” she says.\n“We’ll always remember this,” Tran says. “It’s part of who we are.”\nThis article appears in ourMay 2025 issue.\n",

      "name": "Christopher Eubanks searches for the confidence that brought him to new heights at Wimbledon",
      "body": "Photograph by Growl Bros. Grooming by Jenny Lova/Ursula Wiedmann Models\nSometimes, when his game feels off, Christopher Eubanks watches his own highlights on YouTube. Some of the videos he searches for are from the summer of 2023, when his tennis game peaked at the perfect time and place. He usually chooses his match against Stefanos Tsitsipas, the fifth best player in the world.\nOn his screen, playing on Wimbledon’s Centre Court, Eubanks is on fire. His serve clocks in at a blistering 129 mph, and he rushes the net constantly, pouncing on his opponent’s off-balanced returns. Four hours into the match, in the fifth set, instead of hitting a conservative second serve in play, he hits a 121 mph ace on the center line that freezes Tsitsipas still. Eubanks looks at his coaches in the stands, raises his eyebrows, and laughs.\nIn the clip, Eubanks is 47th in the world, but his play at Wimbledon isbeatingthe best. After another long rally, he stretches his six-foot-seven frame to place a backhand drop shot just out of Tsitsipas’s reach. Eubanks now turns to the onlookers, already on their feet, and waves his arms up and down, sending them into a frenzy.\nTo finally win the match, he smashes a forehand past Tsitsipas. Eubanks’s hands are on his head and his mouth wide open as he takes in another drowning standing ovation from the crowd. “Wimbledon was such a blur,” Eubanks says, watching the highlights. “I was hardly thinking about anything, just my opponent. I was so focused that I can’t remember a lot of it.”\nEubanks, who grew up playing on the courts of theSouth Fulton Tennis Center, announced himself at Wimbledon in 2023. His string of upset wins was impressive, but the reckless abandonment he played with, plus the shock on his face after every win, made him a crowd favorite. His run ended in the quarterfinals, the furthest an American man had gone at the tournament since 2017, and his ranking jumped to number 29 in the world, a career high.\nBut since that summer on grass, Eubanks hasn’t been back on tennis’s biggest stages. The old adage “You’re only as good as your last game” rings particularly true for professional tennis: One bad day in the office punishes players’ ranking, which determines everything from the tournaments they play to the sponsorships they get. A bad year can sink their career. In 2024, Eubanks lost in the first or second round of all four Grand Slams, including a first-round exit at Wimbledon. A year and a half later, his ranking sits at 104th in the world, forcing him to play grueling qualifying tournaments at major events to make the main draw.\nAt 28, Eubanks’s window to rediscover his Wimbledon form is narrowing. His story begins and continues in Atlanta, where he trains in search of the confidence that has made him a world-class tennis player, if only for a moment.\n● ● ●\nWhen Georgia Tech head coach Kenny Thorne showed up to a practice at the South Fulton Tennis Center, he saw a unicorn.\nAlready at a lanky six feet, seven inches, a 17-year-old Eubanks hit with Donald Young Jr., a fellow Atlantan and, at the time, an established pro on the tennis circuit. Eubanks stumbled over himself at times trying to reach Young’s returns, but he would find his feet to hit a smooth one-handed backhand. His whip of a forehand sprayed across the court, with only so-so accuracy. Thorne knew that if Eubanks could develop a reliable winning forehand and a powerful serve, he could be one of the best players in the country.\nFor Thorne and most college coaches, Eubanks came out of nowhere. He was a late bloomer, who only popped up on Georgia Tech’s radar when he nearly beat a program commit at the 2013 USTA Southern Championships a few weeks before Thorne’s visit to South Fulton. Thorne offered Eubanks a spot on Georgia Tech’s team days after he saw him hit with Young.\nPhotograph by Getty Images\nUnlike many of his college and pro peers, Eubanks is a product of the tennis centers in Atlanta’s public parks rather than those at country clubs or private tennis academies. His dad, Mark, and his older brother, Mark Jr., picked up tennis as a hobby because southwest Atlanta has so many accessible spots to play.\nEubanks’s first memories of tennis, and life, are atBurdett Tennis Centerin College Park. When he was four years old, his dad gave him a racket and a tennis ball and told him to go beat the wall. He played in his first tennis tournament at the South Fulton Tennis Center when he was eight. Eubanks lost in a close match in the final, which was enough for his dad to see his potential. “My parents were super busy, with my dad working at Delta and my mom at a bank, but our lives became tennis,” Eubanks says. “So I went to school and then played tennis for hours after.”\nAround this time, a golden age of junior tennis was happening in south Atlanta. Young (formerly the number one junior tennis player in the world), Taylor Townsend (currently the third best female doubles player in the world), and Zack Kennedy (who later rivaled Eubanks in college) all grew up in the area. (Several years later, a certain Coco Gauff also developed her game in south Atlanta.)\n“When they were eight years old, Zack and Eubanks would be the only Black players at some tournaments, so our families connected,” says Sam Kennedy, Zack’s dad and coach. “We all started to hit together, and we just latched onto one another, because that’s what it took.”\nMark Eubanks and Kennedy were self-taught in tennis, and the dads worked together to impart good form and a strong mental game to their sons. “Chris’s dad is very disciplined, and his son was the same,” Kennedy says. “Chris was a calm kid, which made him a great learner for tennis, soaking up everything like a sponge.”\nEven with a childhood dedicated to tennis, Eubanks still experienced growing pains. He was a good junior player but felt he was behind the other juniors who had better training. He played closely with Zack and other strong players but lost matches when doubt crept in. By the time Eubanks got to Westlake High School, Zack played ahead of him on the varsity tennis team. Another hurdle was his height. “He got so tall and skinny at 13, 14, that his head couldn’t tell his arms what to do fast enough,” Kennedy says.\nIn the car on the way to school in the fall of his sophomore year, Eubanks remembers his dad telling him it was time to look at tennis as all or nothing. “He decided that I would start going to South Fulton and train with Donald and the Youngs,” Eubanks says. “There was no warning but also no argument. I felt I wasn’t good enough, but the opportunity was undeniable.”\nEubanks idolized Young, whom many expected to quickly become a top pro player. His parents ran the South Fulton Tennis Center, and when Eubanks joined their tutelage in the fall of 2011, Young was preparing to play tournaments on the pro tour as a 22-year-old. Over a few months of daily lessons, Eubanks’s game improved quickly, and in May 2012, Young offered to bring Eubanks on tour with him.\nThey traveled all over the world that summer, with Eubanks as Young’s hitting partner. “Donald was like my big brother during that trip, and he constantly told me that I was good enough, which was something I really needed to hear,” says Eubanks. “Like, this was a guy who looked like me, from the same side of town, who was always telling me I could do it.”\nWhile Eubanks was in Europe, he missed a crucial summer tennis season for recruiting, when college coaches scout and extend offers to talented high schoolers. But when he returned to practice at Westlake for his junior season, he beat Zack for the first time.\n● ● ●\nAfter Eubanks received his offer to Georgia Tech, the decision for his tennis future again was made for him. “My dad told me that I was going to Georgia Tech,” Eubanks says. “Tech made the most sense with it being home, plus I could still practice with Donald. I think I would have made the same decision.”\nThat decision, ultimately, panned out well for Eubanks. After developing a serve and refining his forehand, he became one of the best players in Georgia Tech tennis history. In three years in the program, he became a two-time All-American and earned Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year twice. He excelled in singles, reaching 90 career wins, which ties him fifth all-time at Georgia Tech.\nIn 2017, he entered the main draw at the Atlanta Open and won his first two professional matches. His performance resulted in a wild card entry to the U.S. Open, where he lost in the first round. As he approached his senior year at Georgia Tech, Eubanks had proved to himself that he was ready to turn professional. This time, he made the decision himself, without consulting his family or coaches.\nGoing pro is easier said than done. Although Eubanks had traveled with Young throughout high school, he was now on his own. He spent the first four years of his career fluctuating between 150th and 230th in the world, playing many small events on tour to find his footing and trying to reach Grand Slams by qualifying. By 2021, his major achievements were a tournament win at an ATP Challenger event in Knoxville and a 2020 U.S. Open doubles quarterfinal appearance. “I always thought it was a matter of time before the results came, but they didn’t,” Eubanks says. “I wasn’t thinking about quitting per se, but I began to feel like I was losing time.”\nPhotograph by Growl Bros\nHis breakthrough came in 2022, off the court. Eubanks saw his fellow Atlantan Taylor Townsend commentating for theTennis ChannelforWomen’s Tennis Association(WTA) events that she didn’t play in. Eubanks loved to talk about tennis with other pros and thought commentating might be fun. His agent reached out to the Tennis Channel to see if there was an opportunity for him to play a similar role. His first match as an announcer was at the 2022 edition of the Knoxville ATP Challenger, the same tournament he had won the year before.\nAnnouncing felt natural for Eubanks and brought an unexpected benefit. In the booth, he couldn’t surf highlights. It forced him to watch matches start to finish, and he started to pick up on the attitudes and patterns that led to success. “Everything seemed so glaringly obvious,” Eubanks says. “I could see myself in a lot of the guys who lost close matches, so if I focused on the little things, I could beat them.”\nEubanks put together the pieces of his puzzle in 2023. In March, he reached the quarterfinals of the Miami Open and lost a close match to the world number three, Daniil Medvedev. For the first time in his career, Eubanks cracked the top 100, debuting at 85. But at the start of the summer grass season, Eubanks was upset in the first round of a small tournament called the Surbiton Challenger.\nHe texted a friend, Grand Slam champion Kim Clijsters, that “grass is the stupidest surface to play tennis on.” Eubanks was surprised that Clijsters would admit she also struggled on grass, and she told him to move on the court more, which should help him get his feet underneath him for both his body and mind.\nIt was what he needed to hear. He won his first ATP Tour title on the grass courts in Mallorca, Spain, on a Saturday, and started qualifiers for Wimbledon on Monday. After the tour win, he started to trust his game. “I was like,I can’t win Mallorca and not get to the first round,” Eubanks says. “Then, once I was in the round, I really just wanted to play on grass as much as I could. After each win, I just thought,Who’s next?”\nHis confidence was so high that you’d forget this was his Wimbledon debut. Next was Cameron Norrie, the 12th best player in the world and number one Brit, backed by his home crowd. To open the second-round match, Eubanks hit a pair of aces, then a smashing forehand winner. He played a nerveless match that dispatched Norrie in four sets. In the third round, Eubanks took care of Australian Christopher O’Connell in straight sets. You know what happened to Tsitsipas in the fourth round.\nFor the quarterfinal, Eubanks matched with Medvedev again. Eubanks felt prepared after their Miami matchup and by commentating on a few of his matches earlier that spring. After losing the first set 4–6, Eubanks’s serve became unstoppable, his play at the net impeccable. Eubanks won the second and third sets in a dominating fashion: 6–1 and 6–4. Medvedev had made only six errors up to that point, but Eubanks was still playing him off the court.\nWith the fourth set tied at 6–6, Eubanks’s serve faltered, and Medvedev evened the match. Maybe it was the heat, or maybe it was the eight matches he had played in two weeks; Eubanks looked exhausted and lost the final set 6–1.\n● ● ●\nThis winter, Eubanks hibernated at theByers Tennis Complex, an indoor facility on Georgia Tech’s campus. Other than a year living in Florida, Eubanks has always stayed in Atlanta, recently moving to an apartment on the Beltline to be closer to where he trains. He’s back in the lab, running through very specific match scenarios with his coaches to mentally prepare.\nAfter his Wimbledon run, Eubanks has struggled to replicate the same form. On the court, he earned spots on Team USA rosters for the 2024 Davis Cup and 2024 Paris Olympics, but with middling results. On the tour, Eubanks lost in the first round of many tournaments, including Wimbledon. Off the court, though, Eubanks has appeared more and more in the commentary booth. He now serves as an analyst and on-court reporter with ESPN at Grand Slams, most recently at the U.S. and Australian Opens, after he exited those tournaments.\n“He can articulate tennis better than almost anyone, and you know, it’s important he does it as a Black man,” Sam Kennedy says. Many of the junior players Kennedy coaches at South Fulton look up to Eubanks and tune in to ESPN to watch the hometown hero commentate. “But the coach in me knows that you can’t replicate Wimbledon unless you’re ‘all in’ one thing.”\nPhotograph from YouTube/The Tennis Channel\nEubanks is careful to balance commitments while recognizing that analyzing tennis unlocked something different at Wimbledon. “I really think commentating has helped me personally,” Eubanks says. “But I’m a tennis player first, and commentating should still just be an opportunity.”\nRecently, there have been signs that Eubanks is ascending again. In November 2024, he won the ATP Challenger in Knoxville, the same tournament that precipitated his success at Wimbledon. Eubanks is confident that his prior up-and-down year made him stronger, and he hopes to get back to where he was as a player, and potentially better than before.\nIn his Beltline apartment, he watches his Wimbledon matches more and more. “It’s cool to see how I served that day and my great shots, but it’s not necessarily to reminisce,” he says. “I want to do everything to get back to that level. I’m trying to remember how I felt.”\nThis article appears in ourApril 2025 issue.\n",

      "body": "Photograph by Growl Bros.\nThe kid is clearly exhausted. Facing a fourth match point in the 1972 American Tennis Association (ATA) National Championships final against Arthur Carrington, a man several years his senior, the kid—Atlantan Horace Reid—can’t hide his fatigue. It’s hard to blame him: The physical toll of this four-hour match has been compounded by cramps and a torn rotator cuff.\nReid, a rising tennis star, cuts an eccentric figure: baby-faced with a short bowling ball of an Afro, mismatched socks, a cuff of rubber bands on either wrist, and a neckband stretched halfway down his torso. Barely 17, Reid looks more as if he’s late for homeroom than about to fend off another match point in a fifth-set tiebreaker. He does all he can to slow his heaving chest, to save his thick-rimmed glasses from slipping down the sweat-slicked slope of his nose.\nThe ATA is the country’s oldest African American tennis organization, and this year’s championship is the first to be televised. With a title on the line, Reid needs to win the next two points—which he precisely does. First, he drops a lob over his opponent’s head, and then, for match point, he smashes two forehands that send Carrington scrambling from end to end. “He goes for it!” Bud Collins, the legendary tennis announcer, gasps on TV, working the broadcast alongside Althea Gibson, a pioneering Black tennis champion. The commentators can barely believe what they’re seeing.\nIt was an improbable win—and one hell of a comeback—for Reid. But for those who knew him, the victory might have seemed inevitable: just the latest entry in the storybook rise of a late-to-the-game prodigy who, at 12, became the first Black player to win a Georgia State Junior Open title (in his first-ever USTA tournament, no less); was ranked top 10 in the nation by 14; and so thoroughly dominated his high school competition he felt the need to leave the state entirely.\nIt wasn’t unreasonable to imagine Reid on a rocket ship to the top of the tennis world. Many already saw him as the next great Black champion—a comparison Arthur Ashe seemed to endorse when he offered his support to Reid. But within a few years, Reid’s tennis dreams would be all but dashed: He’d quit college, fail to find consistency on the pro tour, and suffer an agonizing fallout with Ashe, his hero and would-be mentor. The rupture would not only hamstring Reid’s career, in his telling, but also burden him with a secret he felt he could never share: how everything went so wrong.\n● ● ●\nThe whole thing started innocently enough—or maybe not. It was 1964, the summer Horace Reid turned nine, and the kid wanted to steal a tennis ball. There were just so many of them scattered on the other side of a high fence that separated Washington Park’s new tennis center from the neighborhood. But before Reid could begin his career of petty larceny, he heard a loud voice calling to him. “Hey, young man!”\nThe voice belonged to Branch Curington, a tennis pro who ran the center and would emerge as perhaps the most influential figure in Atlanta’s growing Black tennis community. On this day, Curington instructed Reid to help him pick up balls, offering an ice cream cone as a reward. The next day, Reid returned. But instead of ice cream, Curington handed him a racket.\nFor Reid, who was raised by a single mother, Curington represented more than a coach. “He became a father figure to me. My whole personality is based off of him,” says Reid, who sponged the fundamentals of tennis (and life) at Washington Park.\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nThe game came almost effortlessly. When Reid won the 1967 Georgia State Junior Open, held atBitsy Grant Tennis Center, he did so as an unseeded entrant, becoming a citywide sensation. He began competing on the junior circuit and shot up the rankings, as his local celebrity morphed into national acclaim. Tennis’s chattering class anointed him “the next Arthur Ashe.”\nBilly Martin, the current UCLA men’s tennis coach, remembers Reid’s game vividly. “Biggest forehand ever,” he says. “It was just an awesome shot.” Reid had an aggressive style that could “dominate the court,” per Martin, who also served as his doubles partner. (Together they won the 16-and-under National Clay Court Doubles Championship and made it to the finals of the Junior Orange Bowl.)\nIn a city rife with racial tensions, the effect of Reid’s successes could be seen almost overnight. Suddenly, droves of White kids were showing up at Washington Park, hoping to catch whatever magic dust Curington was sprinkling, while others invited Reid to play at old-money country clubs in north Atlanta.\nFor his part, Reid didn’t reflect too deeply on the meaning of being a Black star in a traditionally White sport. Which isn’t to say he had it easy. Racism stalked his travels across the South, while some within the Black community antagonized him too. Tennis was seen not just as a White game, but also as a “sissy” sport, and he was frequently derided as “a tennis bum” and “a faggot.”\nThrough it all, Reid maintained his confidence and independence. “That’s the Branch in me,” he says. His self-determination fueled his quirky fashion choices as well as his departure from Georgia after winning multiple state titles; high school rules prohibited him from playing in national competitions. It also led him to an early exit from the Port Washington Tennis Academy on Long Island, where he went to train under Harry Hopman, the renowned Australian Davis Cup coach, alongside players like John McEnroe and Vitas Gerulaitis. There, he clashed with Hopman, who favored intense conditioning over the technical development Reid still needed.\nThe breaking point came in the summer before his senior year, when Reid, fed up with Hopman, contacted Ashe. He’d met the champ once before, as an 11-year-old, and had idolized him ever since. Now Reid hoped his hero might thumb the scales on his behalf. Ashe drove to Long Island and brought Reid to Manhattan. As they wove through the city streets, Reid explained his situation: his desire for personalized coaching; his need for sponsorship money; and his dream of attending UCLA, Ashe’s alma mater.\nWhen Ashe agreed to help, even offering use of his apartment, Reid could hardly believe it. “My feet are not even touching the ground at that point,” he recalls. “I got my hero mentoring me, sponsoring me . . . I got it made. There’s nothing that’s not going to be available to me.”\nReid remembers thinking,How can I not succeed?\n● ● ●\nThere were early signs that Reid’s relationship with Ashe wasn’t all it had seemed—or all he’d built it up to be in his mind.\nFor starters, before his first tournament under Ashe’s patronage, Reid got stuck holding the bill after his luggage got lost in transit, despite Ashe’s promise to pay. “He said, ‘Don’t worry. Just keep the receipts,’” says Reid. But the reimbursement never came, and Reid was too timid to ask for the cash. There was also a lengthy letter Reid received that concluded with a list of eight reasons Ashe had decided to help. Reid found the list “strange” on its face, “but the thing that stood out was the eighth reason: because I was Black,” he says. “You’re telling me, in this era, me being Black is thelastreason—theleastimportant reason—for you to help me? I found that really weird.”\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nStill, when Reid arrived at UCLA—where Ashe made good on his word to get him in and even paid for part of his scholarship—things were looking up. On the court, Reid played singles and doubles for one of the country’s top teams. Off the court, he hobnobbed with Hollywood royalty, teaching tennis to A-listers like Gene Hackman and eating Thanksgiving dinner with Marlon Brando.So you can imagine Reid’s surprise when, in a phone call before his sophomore year, Ashe suggested he transfer to a Division II school.\nReid wasn’t just blindsided; he felt betrayed. “It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Reid, who suspects Ashe was acting as a proxy for UCLA’s coach, Glenn Bassett, who he believes wanted his roster spot. “This was strictly him doing his buddy a favor, which hurt.” Questioning whether Ashe had his best interests at heart, Reid refused to transfer. “And, boy, he was not expecting me to say that, and things just went totally south.”\nOstensibly, their arrangement remained unchanged, but Reid sensed a newfound coldness from Ashe, who’d always been standoffish. Previously, sponsorship checks would arrive from around the world with regularity—if not with words of encouragement. Now, the mail stopped coming. Reid was forced to borrow money; he says Ashe promised he’d pay him back but never did. “It was so embarrassing,” says Reid. “He would say something and then wouldn’t do it. He was basically sending me a message. Like, ‘Hey, I’m done with you.’ But why wouldn’t he just say that to my face?”\nThe uncertainty took a toll. “I got so depressed that I stopped going to class,” he says. “He made me feel like I was a bad guy.” When J.D. McGhee, one of Reid’s earliest supporters, died in the summer of 1975, Reid flew home for the funeral—and never returned. “I just dropped out of school,” he says. “I didn’t know what I was going to do.”\n● ● ●\nIn hindsight, Reid concedes he should have transferred to another program. “I still had eligibility,” he says. “I could have gone to any top 10 school.” Instead, reeling from his split with Ashe, he ditched the idea of further collegiate development and set out on the pro tour. It proved an uneven effort.\nDespite his natural talent and flashes of brilliance, including a notable doubles run at the 1979 U.S. Open, Reid struggled to find his footing, peaking at 272 in the ATP singles rankings and 227 in doubles. His game could have used more seasoning, but Reid’s years on the circuit were also plagued by unreliable funding, leading to frequent stretches of inactivity.\nThe narrative of Reid’s career shifted from that of a can’t-miss wunderkind to a once-promising player who’d hit his ceiling. For Reid, this was a lonely time, not least because he felt he couldn’t tell his side of the story. “That’s what killed me,” he says. “I had to bite my lip. I couldn’t say anything, because whose word are you going to take? This guy is a tennis god. I’m a nobody.”\nIn 1982, by which time Reid had effectively given up, a reporter from theAtlanta Constitutionconvinced the then 27-year-old to go on record about his break with Ashe. The resulting article painted an unflattering picture of Reid as a player who just wasn’t good enough. Both Ashe and Bassett claimed Reid couldn’t hack it on a UCLA team that featured players like future champion Brian Teacher and Reid’s old pal Billy Martin. (Martin, who appreciates the difficult roster decisions every coach must make, nonetheless takes exception to this suggestion. He says, “He did make it there! He was on the team, and his level was very high.”) Worst of all was a line from Ashe denying he’d ever agreed to mentor Reid. Said Ashe, “I’ve never had what you might call a protege. I’ve never taken someone in.”\nReading that, Reid felt gaslit. “It still burns,” he says. “And it just pisses me off even more that the guy would sit there and bald-faced lie that he never took on that responsibility.Never had a protege?What do you call spending your money on me? What do you call offering me your apartment?”\nWhatever transpired between the two athletes, there’s no question that Reid’s fractured relationship with Ashe paled in comparison to what he felt had been promised—and that disconnect has come to define, in Reid’s mind, the collapse of his athletic career over the many decades since.\n● ● ●\nPhotograph by Growl Bros.\nToday, Horace Reid works as the tennis director for a community organization in Camilla, about three hours south of Atlanta, where he often feels forgotten. The kids to whom he gives lessons know little about his backstory. It’s true: His name doesn’t ring out across the state as it once did. But according to Richard Howell, who chairs the selection committee for the Georgia Tennis Hall of Fame, nothing should take away from Reid’s legacy.\n“Most young kids don’t even know who Wilt Chamberlain is,” says Howell, whose family helped Reid enter that first USTA tournament in 1967. “Horace has an important place in tennis for what he was able to achieve. He really was a pioneer, and he’s considered one of the legends of Bitsy Grant.”\nIn 1997, Reid was inducted into the Georgia Tennis Hall of Fame. But even that honor couldn’t close the book on his past. There had been a point, in the early ’90s, when Reid, desperate for closure, resolved to confront Ashe. But he never got the chance. “I remember I was in my car driving,” he says, “and on the news comes, ‘Arthur Ashe has died.’” Reid was stunned, and angry. He debated going to the funeral but couldn’t bring himself to do it. “I couldn’t sit there and mourn this guy when I hated him,” he says. “I literally hated him.”\nNow 69, Reid believes there may still be a way to find peace: by taking a kid under his wing, just as Branch Curington did for him. It almost makes too much sense as a final chapter—to become the next Curington, the anti-Ashe—assuming he can locate such a youngster. “I haven’t found [that] one kid that wants to eat, sleep, and drink tennis like I did,” says Reid. “That’s literally all I want to do. Find a kid that wants to be great, and give them all the help that I got.”\nAnd all the help he never did.\nThis article appears in ourApril 2025 issue.\n",
